<FAQBox title="What is Fluvio?">
  Fluvio is a lean distributed streaming engine built by the team at InfinyOn.
  Fluvio is designed, architected, and built from the ground up to be edge
  ready, cloud native, secure, memory safe, high performance, scalable and
  reliable.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Who is Fluvio for?">
  Fluvio is for developers who build data flows to power intelligent
  applications. Fluvio provides developers with APIs and SDKs to create data
  integrations to collect and distribute data, primitives to process,
  transform, and enrich data including deduplication, enrichment with 3rd party
  API callouts, as well as stateful aggregations into materialized views.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="In what use cases and scenarios does Fluvio make developer workflows effective?">
  Software and data engineers use Fluvio as the distributed streaming engine to
  serve as the core message queue or service bus to create a variety of use
  case patterns in operational analytics, user facing analytics, real-time
  insights, anomaly detection and more.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How is this different from ETL/ELT/Batch processing tools?">
  Fluvio is a distributed streaming engine that processes records in real-time
  as they arrive.

  Unlike ETL/ELT batch processing, which handles large volumes of static data
  at fixed intervals, Fluvio enables continuous data processing. While both
  approaches can apply similar business logic, batch processing excels at
  descriptive historical analysis on regular schedules. In contrast, streaming
  is essential for event-driven architectures and operational systems requiring
  immediate data processing.

  This makes Fluvio ideal for applications in telemetry, monitoring,
  operational analytics, and intelligent distributed applications like edge AI
  ro real-time AI, where real-time event processing is crucial.

<FAQBox title="How does Fluvio differ from other streaming platforms?">
  Fluvio distinguishes itself as a comprehensive, ground-up streaming platform,
  diverging from traditional solutions that cobble together multiple tools and
  libraries.

  Upcoming streaming platforms often focus on optimizing existing
  components—such as enhancing storage speed, file formats, metadata usage, and
  infrastructure management—Fluvio takes a fundamentally different approach.

  Built from scratch using Rust, it leverages cutting-edge advances in
  hardware, kernel technology, and compiler design to ensure superior
  performance, memory safety, and resource efficiency.

  Fluvio includes a full suite of CLI tools, APIs, and SDKs, to give developers
  the control and the flexibility to create modular, end-to-end data flows.

  Fluvio uses WebAssembly for data processing packages to implement nimble,
  secure, and flexible components. This cohesive design offers developers a
  unified paradigm for building streaming applications, eliminating the
  complexity and integration challenges associated with piecing together
  disparate tools and libraries.

<FAQBox title="What are the core components of Fluvio?">
  The ecosystem of tools to build with Fluvio are:

  Fluvio Core - Distributed streaming engine or runtime. 37 MB Single binary
  package. Download with a script. Cloud native deployed in Kubernetes pods on
  InfinyOn Cloud.

  Fluvio Clients - Rust Client, Python Client, Node Client and some.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Does Fluvio runs on Windows?">
  Fluvio is designed to run on Linux and MacOS. Windows support is not available
  at this time.

  However, you can run Fluvio on Windows using WSL2.

  To run Fluvio on Windows, you need to install WSL2 and a Linux distribution
  such as Ubuntu. Once you have WSL2 installed, you can follow the instructions
  to install Fluvio on Linux.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How can I integrate Fluvio with my project?">
  Fluvio provides SDKs (API Clients) for Rust, Python, Node.js.
  Other experimental and community maintained SDKs are available for other
  languages.

  You can learn more under the [APIs](/docs/apis/quickstart) section.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Do I need InfinyOn Cloud to run Fruvio?">
  No, you can run Fluvio on any Kubernetes cluster. InfinyOn Cloud is the
  preferred platform for Fluvio, as it provides a seamless experience for
  deploying, managing, and scaling Fluvio clusters.

  You can also run Fluvio locally on your machine for development and testing
  purposes.
