# Introduction

The InfinyOn Hub is cloud infrastructure for sharing and discovering SDF package.  Please see [Hub] for more information.

An SDF Package can be published as either a public or private package.  Public packages are available to anyone without restriction.  Private packages are only available to users who have been granted access to the namespace.

By default, all packages are private unless explicitly published as public.



# Ready for Publishing

SDF Package are immutable.  Once published, the package cannot be changed.  If you need to make changes, you will need to create a new version of the package.  This is why it is important to ensure that the package is tested and ready for publishing.

SDF package follow semver versioning.  The version number is specified in the `meta.version` field of the package file.

Before publishing,
- Test with `sdf test` to ensure it is working with sample data.
- Run with test dataflow to ensure it is working in a dataflow.

To test with a dataflow, create a dataflow file and add `dev` section as below: 
```
dev:
  imports:
    - pkg: example/sentence-pkg@0.1.0
      path: ./packages/sentence
```

This will let dataflow use the package from the local directory.

Then run the dataflow with with ephemeral mode: `sdf run --ephemeral` otherwise dataflow will not be able to find the package.

# Publishing

After tested and ready, you can publish the package with `sdf hub publish` command.  Remember, by default, packages are private.  

```bash
$ sdf hub publish
```

To list all the packages you can see: `sdf hub list` command.

```bash
$ sdf hub list
```

## Publishing as package as public, use `--public` flag

```bash
$ sdf hub publish --public
```


# Using Hub Package from Dataflow or Package

Please see [Imports] for more information on how to define `imports` in the dataflow or package file that references the package from the Hub.

When you run the dataflow or package, the package will be automatically downloaded from the Hub and used.
