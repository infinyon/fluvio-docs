**Composable Dataflows** allow you to create individual [package](#packages) and import them to create [dataflows](#the-dataflow). They are a great way to organize and reuse your code in large dataflows. For simple dataflows, we recommend using [Inline Dataflows].

## Directory Structure

Dataflow and packages require a definition file for code generation and composition:

* [sdf-package.yaml](#sdf-packageyaml) -  code generation definitions
* [dataflow.yaml](#dataflowyaml) - composition definitions

Consequently, each dataflow and package must have its dedicated directory.

For example, a dataflow named `split-sentence` and a package `sentence`:

```bash
split-sentence
├── dataflow.yaml
└── packages
    ├── sentence
    │   └── sdf-package.yaml
```

While placing the packages inside a dataflow is not strictly necessary, it often makes sense.


## Packages

**Packages** are dataflow building blocks of one or more types, states, and functions. You can structure all the components in one package or divide them by responsibility across multiple packages. The packages also allow hierarchical imports, where a package can use other packages' types, states, or functions.


#### `sdf-package.yaml`

The [SDF] command line tool uses the stateful dataflows package definition file `sdf-package.yaml` to generate the code and state and type definitions for the package. The package file has the following hierarchy:

```yaml name="sdf-package.yaml"
apiVersion: <version>

meta:
  name: <package-name>
  version: <package-version>
  namespace: <package-namespace>

imports:
  - pkg: <package-namespace>/<package-name>@<package-version>
    types:
      - name: <type-name>
    functions:
      - name: <function-name>
    states:
      - name: <state-name>

types:
  <type-name>: <type-props>

states:
  <state-name>: <state-props>

functions:
  <function-name>:
    operator: <operator-type>
    states:
      - name: <state-name>
    inputs:
      - name: <input-name>
        type: <input-type>
    output:
      type: <output-type>

dev:
  converter: <converter-props>
  imports:
    - pkg:  <package-namespace>/<package-name>@<package-version>
      path: <relative-path>

```

The sections are as follows:
* `meta` - metadata about the package
* `imports` - imports other packages' types, states, functions
* `types` - defines types used in the package
* `states` - defines states used in functions
* `functions` - defines functions in the package
* `dev` - defines substitutions used during development and test


#### Build and Test a Package

We'll use the [SDF] command line tool with the package definition file to generate the WebAssembly glue code and the placeholder for the custom logic.

```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf -h
Stateful Dataflow Command Line Interface

Usage: sdf <COMMAND>

Commands:
 clean     Clean generated artifacts such as state and internal objects
 build     Build package (requires: sdf-package.yaml)
 generate  Generate package (requires: sdf-package.yaml)
 update    Update package (requires: sdf-package.yaml)
 test      Test command shell (requires sdf-package.yaml)
 run       Run dataflow  (requires: dataflow.yaml)
 setup     Setup pre-requisites for Stateful Dataflows
 version   Prints binary version
 log       Print dataflow logs
```

Let's start with an example. Create a package that split sentences into words and counts the number of characters in each word.

##### 1. Create the Package file

Create a fresh project directory `split-sentence` with two subdirectories: `packages` and `sentence`:

```bash
$ mkdir -p split-sentence/packages/sentence
$ cd split-sentence/packages/sentence
```

Inside the `sentence` directory and create the `sdf-package.yaml` and add the following content:

```yaml
#sdf-package.yanl
apiVersion: 0.5.0

meta:
  name: sentence-pkg
  version: 0.1.0
  namespace: example

functions:

  sentence-to-words:
    operator: flat-map
    inputs:
      - name: sentence
        type: string
    output:
      type: string

  augment-count:
    operator: map
    inputs:
      - name: word
        type: string
    output:
      type: string

dev:
  converter: raw
```

##### 2. Generate the Package Project

Use SDF generate command to build the project:

```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf generate
```

The generator created several directories and files that we'll edit next.


##### 3. Add the Custom Code

First, let's update the first function, `sentence-to-words`. Open `rust/sentence-to-words/src/lib.rs` and update the function body with the following code:

```rust
pub(crate) fn sentence_to_words(sentence: String) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
    Ok(sentence.split_whitespace().map(String::from).collect())
}
```

Next update `augment_count`. Open `rust/augment-count/src/lib.rs` and replace the function body:

```rust
pub(crate) fn augment_count(word: String) -> Result<String> {
    Ok(format!("{}({})", word, word.chars().count()))
}
```

Let's add some tests as well:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_augment_count() {
        let input = "Hello".to_string();
        let output = augment_count(input);
        assert_eq!(output.unwrap(), "Hello(5)");
    }
}
```

We've implemented both functions; it's time to compile and test our work.


##### 4. Build and Test the Package

To build the package, run:

```bash
$ sdf build
```

Use `sdf test` interactive shell to test the code:

```bash
$ sdf test
```

In the test shell, you can view the functions available for testing:

```bash copy="fl"
>> show functions
sentence-to-words
augment-count
```

Let's test `sentence-to-words` first:

```bash copy="fl"
>> test function sentence-to-words --input "Hello World"
Hello
World
```

Next, test `augment-count`:

```bash copy="fl"
>> test function augment-count --input "Hello"
Hello(5)
```

You may also test the `rust` code via Cargo:

```bash
$ cd rust
$ cargo test
```

The tests passed, and the package is now ready to use in the dataflow file.

## The Dataflow

The **dataflow** imports functions, types, and states from one more package. Packages may also import components from others; however, dataflow maintains the final composition.


#### `dataflow.yaml`

The [SDF] command line tool uses the dataflow definition file `dataflow.yaml` to assemble the data application, and it has the following hierarchy:

```yaml name="dataflow.yaml"
apiVersion: <version>

meta:
  name: <dataflow-name>
  version: <dataflow-version>
  namespace: <dataflow-namespace>

imports:
  - pkg: <package-namespace>/<package-name>@<package-version>
    types:
      - name: <type-name>
    functions:
      - name: <function-name>
    states:
      - name: <state-name>

config:
  converter: <converter-props>
  consumer: <consumer-props>

types:
  <type-name>: <type-props>

topics:
  <topic-name>: <topic-props>

services:
  <service-name>:
    sources:
      -type: <source-props>

    states:
      <state-name>: <state-props>

    transforms:
      - operator: <operator-type>
        uses: <imported-function-name>

    sinks:
      - type: <sink-props>

dev:
  converter: <converter>
  imports:
    - pkg:  <package-namespace>/<package-name>@<package-version>
      path: <relative-path>
```

The sections are as follows:
* `meta` - metadata about the package
* `imports` - imports other packages' types, states, functions
* `config` - short for configurations, holds the default configurations.
* `types` - defines types used in the package
* `topics` - defines topics used in the package
* `states` - defines states used in functions
* `services` - defines the service properties
  * `sources` - defines the source topics used in the service
  * `states` - defines the state properties used in the service
  * `transforms` - defines the list of operators and the imported functions used in the service
  * `sinks` - defines the sink topics used in the service
* `dev` - defines substitutions used during development and test

The dataflow file has other variants such as `window` and `partitions`, which are omitted for simplicity. For additional details check the [Dataflow file] section.


#### Create a Dataflow

We'll import the package built in the [previous](#build-and-test-a-package) section to create the `split-sentence` dataflow.

##### 1. Create the Dataflow file

Ceate a dataflow file in the directory `split-sentence` directory:

```bash
$ cd split-sentence
```

Create the `dataflow.yaml` and add the following content:

```yaml name="dataflow.yaml"
apiVersion: 0.5.0

meta:
  name: split-sentence
  version: 0.1.0
  namespace: example

imports:
  - pkg: example/sentence-pkg@0.1.0
    functions:
      - name: sentence-to-words
      - name: augment-count

config:
  converter: raw

topics:
  sentence:
    schema:
      value:
        type: string
        converter: raw
  words:
    schema:
      value:
        type: string
        converter: raw

services:
  sentence-words:
    sources:
      - type: topic
        id: sentence

    transforms:
      - operator: flat-map
        uses: sentence-to-words
      - operator: map
        uses: augment-count

    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: words

dev:
  imports:
    - pkg: example/sentence-pkg@0.1.0
      path: ./packages/sentence
```

##### 2. Run the Dataflow

Use `sdf` command line tool to run the dataflow:

```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf run --dev
```

Use `--dev` to ask the engine to change the path to the local package. Without this flag, the engine will look for the package in `InfinyOn Hub`.


##### 3. Test the Dataflow

1. Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio produce sentence
```

```bash
Hello world
Hi there
```

Consume from `words` to retrieve the result:

```bash
$ fluvio consume words -Bd
```

```bash
Hello(5)
world(5)
Hi(2)
there(5)
```

##### 4. Show State

The dataflow collects runtime metrics that you can inspect in the runtime terminal.

Check the `sentence-to-words` counters:

```bash copy="fl"
>> show state sentence-words/sentence-to-words/metrics --table
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       2          0
```

Check the `augment-count` counters:

```bash copy="fl"
>> show state sentence-words/augment-count/metrics --table
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       4          0
```

Congratulations! You've successfully built and run a composable dataflow! The project is available for download in [github].

##### 5. Clean-up

Exit the `sdf` terminal and remove the topics:

```bash
fluvio topic delete sentence
fluvio topic delete words
```
