# SDF Quickstart

Provisioning and operating a Stateful Dataflow requires the following system components:

1. [Fluvio Cluster] to enable dataflows to consume and produce streaming data.

2. [Dataflow File][dataflow-yaml] to define the schema, composition, services, and operations.


The Stateful Dataflows can be built, tested, and run locally during preview releases. As we approach general availability, they can also be deployed in your InfinyOn Cloud cluster. In addition, the dataflows may be published to [Hub] and shared with others with one click and installation.


# Inline Definitions

Inline dataflows are [dataflow.yaml][dataflow-yaml] files that include everything necessary to run a data pipeline. Inline dataflows are useful for trying out various features of the product. Deploying an inline dataflow is simple:

1. [Download (or create) a dataflow file](#1-create-the-dataflow-file)
2. [Run the dataflow](#2-run-the-dataflow)

While inline dataflows are a breeze to get started with, maintaining code in `yaml` is not always ideal. For complex projects, we recommend using [Composable Dataflows].


## Create and Run a Dataflow

Let's create a simple dataflow to split a sentence into words and count the words.


### 1. Installing SDF CLI

Staetful dataflow are managed via [sdf cli] that we install it using [fvm].

```
$ fvm install sdf-beta1.1
```

### 2. Create the Dataflow file

Create a dataflow file in the directory `split-sentence` directory:

```bash
$ mkdir -p split-sentence-inline
$ cd split-sentence-inline
```

Create the `dataflow.yaml` and add the following content:

```yaml title="dataflow.yaml"
apiVersion: 0.5.0

meta:
  name: split-sentence-inline
  version: 0.1.0
  namespace: example

config:
  converter: raw

topics:
  sentence:
    schema:
      value:
        type: string
        converter: raw
  words:
    schema:
      value:
        type: string
        converter: raw

services:
  sentence-words:
    sources:
      - type: topic
        id: sentence

    transforms:
      - operator: flat-map
        run: |
          fn sentence_to_words(sentence: String) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
            Ok(sentence.split_whitespace().map(String::from).collect())
          }
      - operator: map
        run: |
          pub fn augment_count(word: String) -> Result<String> {
            Ok(format!("{}({})", word, word.chars().count()))
          }

    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: words
```

### 3. Run the Dataflow

Use `sdf` command line tool to run the dataflow:

```bash
$ sdf run --ui --ephemeral
```

Use `--ui` to generate the graphical representation and run the Studio.

### 4. Test the Dataflow

Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio produce sentence
```


```bash
Hello world
Hi there
```

Consume from `words` to retrieve the result:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume words -Bd
```

```bash
Hello(5)
world(5)
Hi(2)
there(5)
```

### 5. Show State

The dataflow collects runtime metrics that you can inspect in the runtime terminal.

Check the `sentence-to-words` counters:

```bash copy="fl"
>> show state sentence-words/sentence-to-words/metrics
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       2          0
```

Check the `augment-count` counters:

```bash copy="fl"
>> show state sentence-words/augment-count/metrics
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       4          0
```

Congratulations! You've successfully built and run a composable dataflow! The project is available for download in [github].

### 6. Clean-up

Exit `sdf` terminal and remove the topics:

```bash
sdf clean --force
```

**Note** The `--force` keyword should only be used if you want to remove everything, including the topics created by this dataflow.
