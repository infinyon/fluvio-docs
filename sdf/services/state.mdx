States are persistent objects that facilitate the collection and retrieval of data generated by streams of records. collect data across streams of records. With states, dataflows can build tables, compute aggregates, join datasets, perform anomaly detections, etc.

In technical terms, states are materialized following [CQRS architecture], where a builder service reads a stream of records and creates a materialized view for one or more readers. The builder service is separate from the reader services.

## State Types

States are `key/value` types, defined as the keyword `keyed-state`, where:

* **key** is the unique identifier for each object in the state. The key must be a `string`.
* **value** can be [primitive](#primitive-value) or [arrow-row](#arrow-row-value).

You should choose between [primitive](#primitive-value) and [arrow-row](#arrow-row-value) based on the data types and the operations you intend to perform on the state. Use primitive values to store nested objects for key-based look-ups, and arrow-row values to join datasets or perform SQL operations.


### Primitive Value

The `primitive` values allows you to define objects using primitive [types] definitions. You may think if primitive states as key/value stores, such as mongodb. The advantages of this format is that it allows hierarchical objects. The following example shows a state object where the value is a 32 bit unsigned integer.

```yaml
states:
  count-per-word:
    type: keyed-state
    properties:
      key:
          type: string
      value:
          type: primitive
          properties:
            value: i32
```

**Note**: In this beta release, the system only supports `i32`, with full support for hierachical objects coming soon.


### Arrow-Row Value

The `arrow-row` values are defined using arrow [types] definitions. The arrow-row states are stored in [arrow dataframe] format. You may think of an arrow state as databases, such as postgress. The advantage of this format is that is accessible by third-party libraries such as [Polars]. An`arrow-row state is defined as follows:

```yaml
states:
  temperature:
    type: keyed-state
    properties:
      key:
        type: string
      value:
        type: arrow-row
        properties:
          sensor:
            type: string
          temperature:
            type: f32
```

Check out the [types] section for addition information on arrow types.


## State Definition & Usage

The state objects are defined in the `states` section of an [sdf-package.yaml] file, or inside a `service` section in the [dataflow.yaml] file. States defined in a package file are imported in a dataflow file.


### Inline Definitions (dataflow.yaml)

Inline states are defined in a [dataflow.yaml] file. We'll use an example to show how to use define and use states in a dataflow file.

In most cases, a state processing operation has `3-steps` in 2 different services:

* [Define State - service1](#step-1-define-state)
* [Update State - service1](#step-2-update-state)
* [Lookup State - service2](#step-3-lookup-state)


#### Step 1: Define State

In this example, we define a `count-words` service and a `count-per-word` state. As this service defines the state, it is also responsible for updating it.

```yaml
services:
  count-words:
    states:
      count-per-word:
        type: keyed-state
        properties:
          key:
            type: string
          value:
            type: arrow-row
            properties:
              count:
                type: i32
```

Note, that state type could have been defined in the `types` section.


#### Step 2: Update State

Service responsible for updating the state object must have an `update-state` operator. This is where the state is updated.

```yaml
update-state:
  run: |
    fn increment_word_count(word: String) -> Result<(), String> {
      let mut count = count_per_word();
      count.value += 1;
      count.update();
      Ok(())
    }
```

In this example we look-up the previous count, increment it and update it.

Except for [window processing] where the service concludes with a  `flush` operation, the `update_state` operation is the last operation of the service.


#### Step 3: Lookup State

Next we'll define a service that listens to a data stream of words and returns their count. This service is a separate flow triggered by another data stream.

In this example, we define a service `lookup-word` that receives words from a data stream, looks-up each word in `count-per-word` state, and converts the result into a `json` value.

```yaml
lookup-word:
  states:
    count-per-word:
      from: count-words.count-per-word

  transforms:
    - operator: map
      run: |
        fn query_word_count(word: String) -> Result<WordCount, String> {
          use polars::prelude::{col,lit,IntoLazy};

          let df = count_per_word();
          let val = df.clone().lazy()
              .filter(col("_key").eq(lit(word.clone())))
              .collect().expect("parse");

          if let Some(count) = val.column("count").unwrap().i32().unwrap().get(0) {
            Ok(WordCount{word, count})
          } else {
            Ok(WordCount{word, count: 0})
          }
        }
```

When a service accesses a state, it needs to define the target location, which in our example is `count-words`. Use an operator `map` to match the `word` from the stream with a value from `count_per_word`. We use [Polars] to perform the query operation. If the value exists, the result is the word and associated count, otherwise zero.

The look-up sends the result to the next stage of data data pipeline.


## States & Packages

State can be defined in a package [sdf-package.yaml] file. The apporach allows you to implement and test states independently from the [dataflow.yaml] file.

We'll use an example to show how to implement, test, and import a state from a package file.
