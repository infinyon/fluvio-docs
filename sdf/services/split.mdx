Dataflows can split events data into multiple topics. The split behavior is defined in the `sinks` section of the service definition. Similar to merge, the split operation can transform the event to match a target topic schema.

```yaml
  sinks:
    - type: topic
      id: <topic-id>
      transforms:
        - operator: <operator-name>
          ...
    - type: topic
      id: <topic-id>
      transforms:
        - operator: <operator-name>
```

The `transforms` section defines the transformation to apply to the event before sending it to the target topic. The operator type depends on the desired business logic.


## Split Example

We'll create a dataflow that reads `person` records from the `user`topic and splits them into `child` and `adult` topics based on age.

#### 1. Create a Dataflow file

Create a directory `split-test`:

```bash copy="fl"
$ mkdir split-test; cd split-test
```

Add the following `dataflow.yaml` file:

```yaml
# dataflow.yaml
apiVersion: 0.5.0

meta:
  name: split
  version: 0.1.0
  namespace: examples

config:
  converter: json

types:
  person:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
      age:
        type: i32

topics:
  user:
    schema:
      value:
        type: person
  child:
    schema:
      value:
        type: person
  adult:
    schema:
      value:
        type: person
services:
  split-service:
    sources:
      - type: topic
        id: user
    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: child
        transforms:
          - operator: filter
            run: |
              fn is_child(person: Person) -> Result<bool> {
                  Ok(person.age < 18)
              }
      - type: topic
        id: adult
        transforms:
          - operator: filter
            run: |
              fn is_adult(person: Person) -> Result<bool> {
                  Ok(person.age >= 18)
              }
```

In this example, we used the `filter` operator as the target schema matches the source. If there is a mismatch, use `filter-map` and update the record accordingly.

Run dataflow:

```bash  copy="fl"
$ sdf run
```

Add `--ui` if you want to see the graphical representation of the dataflow.


#### 2. Test the Dataflow

Produce to `user`:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio produce user
```

```bash
{"name":"Andrew","age":16}
{"name":"Jackson","age":17}
{"name":"Randy","age":32}
{"name":"Alice","age":28}
{"name":"Linda","age":15}
```

Consume from `child`:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume child -Bd
```

```bash
{"age":16,"name":"Andrew"}
{"age":17,"name":"Jackson"}
{"age":15,"name":"Linda"}
```

Consume from `adult`:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume adult -Bd
```

```bash
{"age":32,"name":"Randy"}
{"age":28,"name":"Alice"}
```

In summary, `split-service` utilizes `sinks` to divide the data into two different topics: `child` and `adult.` The `child` filter operator passes records with ages less than 18 years old. The `adult` filter operator passes records with an age greater or equal to 18 years old.
