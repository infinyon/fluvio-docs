# Merge

Services in fluvio can be defined to have multiple sinks and sources. In this example, we will implement a service that takes in multiple sources via a merge. The example will simulate buying and selling stocks. There is a topic `buy` and another topic `sell` that aggreate to create a log of buy and sell orders. The visual shows the dataflow we will implement.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

## Transformation

We can add a transform operator to our source list.
```YAML
source:
  - type: topic
    id: (...)
    transforms:
      - operator: map
        run: |
          (... filter function ...)
    (... more topics ...)
```
In our case, we have two topics `buy` and `sell` that read json objects that include a name, amount, and price. We will map the json object into a string that gets sent into the topic `message` which will log the orders.

```YAML
sources:
  - type: topic
    id: buy
    transforms:
      - operator: map
        run: |
          fn buy_order(order: Order) -> Result<String> {
            Ok(format!("+ Buy Order for  {}x{} at {}",order.name,order.amount,order.price))
          }
  - type: topic
    id: sell 
    transforms:
      - operator: map
        run: |
          fn sell_order(order: Order) -> Result<String> {
            Ok(format!("- Sell Order for {}x{} at {}",order.name,order.amount,order.price))
          }
```

## Running the Example

Copy and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`.


<CodeBlock language="yaml">{Merge}</CodeBlock>

To run example:
```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf run --ephemeral
```

Produce json objects to each of the topics:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ echo '{"name":"AMZN","amount":20,"price":173.33}' | fluvio produce buy
$ echo '{"name":"TSLA","amount":20,"price":219.41}' | fluvio produce sell
```

Consume topic `message` to retrieve the result:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume message -Bd
"+ Buy Order for  AMZNx20 at 173.33"
"- Sell Order for TSLAx20 at 219.41"
```

Both the buy order and sell order has been mapped into a string to be logged.

## Cleanup

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf clean --force
```


## Conclusion

In this example, we covered how to use merge to allow services to consume multiple sources.
