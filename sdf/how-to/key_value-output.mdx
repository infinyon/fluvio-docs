Continuing from the last tutorial about inputs using key-values, we will use store entries as key-values. We can view this as the reverse of the previous tutorial.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

## Dataflow

### Overview
For this example, we will right a dataflow that tracks books in a library system. It will take a book from the source and return the book as a value combined with a barcode as the key. We will write a short hashing function that takes the title and hashes it into a barcode that will serve as the key for our sink.

### Define the types

Like the previous example, we will need to define our types. This time, its a little shorter.

```YAML
types:
  book:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
      year:
        type: u32
      author:
        type: string
```

### Topic List
The following is our list of topics.
```YAML
topics:
  new-book:
    schema:
      value:
        type: book
  books-in-system:
    schema:
      key:
        type: string
      value:
        type: book
```
##### Source
The `new-book` is the source topic. 

##### Sink
The `books-in-system` is the sink topic. It contains a `string` key and a `book` object.


### Transform
We will apply a transform to take the `Book` entries into the tuple `(String,Book)`. 

```YAML
transforms:
  - operator: map
    run: |
      fn newbook(book:Book) -> Result<(Option<String>,Book)>{
        let mut p:u32 = 53; 
        let m:u32 = 1000000009;
        let mut hash:u32 = 0;
        for c in book.name.chars() {
            hash = (hash + (c as u32)*p) % m;
            p = (p*53) % m;
        }
        
        Ok((Some(hash.to_string()),book))
      }
```
The following just calculates the hash value and returns it as the barcode.

## Running the Example
### Full Code
Copy and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`.
<CodeBlock language="yaml">{KeyValueOutput}</CodeBlock>

### Running SDF
To run example:
```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf run --ephemeral
```

### Produce data
We will produce some data by first writing it into a file name `book.txt`.
```bash 
{ "author": "Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie", "name": "C Programming Language", "year": 1988 }
{ "author": "Anany Levitin", "name": "Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms", "year": 2001 }
{ "author": "Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols", "name": "The Rust Programming Language", "year": 2018 }
{ "author": "Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols", "name": "Rust Cookbook", "year": 2020 }
```

We can produce data via
```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio produce new-book -f book.txt
$ fluvio consume new-book -Bdk
```

### Consume data
To consume the data
```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume books-in-system -Bdk
[439139953] {"author":"Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie","name":"C Programming Language","year":1988}
[747501183] {"author":"Anany Levitin","name":"Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms","year":2001}
[305905177] {"author":"Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols","name":"The Rust Programming Language","year":2018}
[605191240] {"author":"Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols","name":"Rust Cookbook","year":2020}
```

We can see that the key is the hash value followed by the data of the book.

## Cleanup

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf clean --force
```


## Conclusion

This how-to focused on using key-values as out. The following pages contains another example of `key-value` as inputs.
