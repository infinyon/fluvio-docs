In this tutorial we use key-values. Key-values are entries that take record a key and the corresponding value. This example will focus on taking inputs from a key-value topic to a non-key-value topic.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

## Dataflow

### Overview
In this example, we will write an example that takes inputs from a key-value topic then transforms it via a `filter-map` to select only students in a certain class.

### Define the types

For this example, we will not be using primitive types. We have the following objects.

```YAML
types:
  student-info:
    type: object
    properties:
      age:
        type: u32
      teacher:
        type: string
      grade:
        type: f32
  student-in-class:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
      grade:
        type: f32
```

We have two object types here. A `student-info` that stores the value of the source. And `student-in-class` that captures the sink's type.

### Topic List
The following is our list of topics.
```YAML
topics:
  student-list:
    schema:
      key:
        type: string
      value:
        type: student-info
  profx-students:
    schema:
      value:
        type: student-in-class
```
##### Source
The `student-list` is the source topic. It maps a primitive `string` to a `student-info`. For our example, the primitive `string` will be the name of the student.

##### Sink
The `profx-students` is the sink topic. It contains the type `student-in-class` defined above.


### Transform
We will apply a transform to take the tuple `(String,StudentInfo)` entries into `StudentInClass`. We will apply a `filter-map` transform to filter out students that do not have `profX` in their teacher entry.

```YAML
transforms:
  - operator: filter-map
    run: |
      fn make_user(name: Option<String>, info: StudentInfo) -> Result<Option<StudentInClass>>{
        if info.teacher != "profX" {
            return Ok(None);
        }
        let ret = StudentInClass{
            name: name.unwrap_or("".to_string()),
            grade: info.grade
        };
        Ok(Some(ret))
      }
```
In this transfrom function, the input parameters contain a variable for the key, `name`, and another for the value, `info`.

## Running the Example
### Full Code
Copy and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`.

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{KeyValueInput}</CodeBlock>

### Running SDF
To run example:
```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf run --ephemeral
```

### Produce data
We will produce some data by first writing it into a file name `student.txt`.
```bash 
Jerry>{"age":13,"teacher":"profX","grade":90.1} 
Tom>{"age":14,"teacher":"profY","grade":99.2} 
Jane>{"age":-1,"teacher":"profZ","grade":99.11} 
Terry>{"age":13,"teacher":"profX","grade":50}
```

We can produce data via
```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio produce student-list --key-separator ">" -f student.txt
```

We should see the following output if we consume with `-k`

```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume student-list -Bdk
[Jerry] {"age":13,"teacher":"profX","grade":90.1}
[Tom] {"age":14,"teacher":"profY","grade":99.2}
[Jane] {"age":-1,"teacher":"profZ","grade":99.11}
[Terry] {"age":13,"teacher":"profX","grade":50}
```

### Consume data
To consume the data.
```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume profx-students -Bd
{"grade":90.1,"name":"Jerry"}
{"grade":50.0,"name":"Terry"}
```

Only students with teacher names `profX` is sent to the sink.

## Cleanup

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf clean --force
```
