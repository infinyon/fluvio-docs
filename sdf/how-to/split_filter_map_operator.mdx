# Split Filter Operator

Like the `Split Filter` operator, the `Split Filter-Map` operator extends the functionality of a traffic splitter with the filter-map transformation. The operator canselectively filter out what entries enter what sinks while also applying mapping functionality. The following example is an extension of the [filter map example][filter_map]. We will implement a dataflow that can detect the whether or not an input is a valid addition or substraction statement, compute the equation, and send it to the right sink.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

## Transformation

The `filter-map` transformation is placed in the sink section. 
```YAML
sinks:
  - type: topic
    id: (...)
    transforms:
      - operator: filter-map
        run: |
          (... filter map function ...)
    (... more topics ...)
```
The function defined should take in the input and return a `Result<Option<...>>`. The `Result<Option<...>>` is either a `Some(...)` if the input is not filtered or a `None` if the input should be filtered. The following are our transformations. The code is shortened for brevity but the full example is below. The regex and calculation is just replaced for the `dosubtraction` topic compared to the [filter map example][filter_map].

```YAML
sinks:
  - type: topic
    id: doaddition
    transforms: 
      - operator: filter-map 
        dependencies:
          - name: regex
            version: "1"
        run: |
          fn do_addition(input: String) -> Result<Option<String> > {
            (...)
          }
  - type: topic
    id: dosubtraction
    transforms: 
      - operator: filter-map 
        dependencies:
          - name: regex
            version: "1"
        run: |
          fn do_substraction(input: String) -> Result<Option<String> > {
            let re = regex::Regex::new(r"^(\d+)-(\d+)=$").unwrap();
            if let Some(num) = re.captures(&input) {
                (...)
                return Ok(Some(format!("{}{}",input,(a-b))));
            } else{
                return Ok(None);
            }
          }
```

## Running the Example

Copy and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`.


<CodeBlock language="yaml">{SplitFilterMap}</CodeBlock>

To run example:
```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf run
```

Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ echo "Hello world" | fluvio produce sentences
$ echo "9999+1=" | fluvio produce sentences
$ echo "9999-1=" | fluvio produce sentences
```

Consume topic `doaddition` to retrieve the result in another terminal:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume doaddition -Bd
9999+1=10000
```

Consume the other topic `dosubtraction`
```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume dosubtraction -Bd
9999-1=9998
```

We can see the first entry `Hello World` is discarded, but the other two are sent to the right topic with the respective mapping calculation done.


## Cleanup

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf clean --force
```


## Conclusion

In this example, we covered how to use split traffic with the filter map operator.
