This tutorial is a continuation from the previous state example. This tutorial shows how to use arrow-rows to store more complicated data types not available in primitive key-values. Read more about [arrow rows][arrow]. We will continue from the tutorial from the merge example to have a saved balance.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

## Dataflow

### Overview
In this example, we will first show how to create a state, update the state as data enters from the source, and how to interface with the state. The state and update will be defined in the `mergeservice` and the interfacing will be defined in the `interface` service.

### Mergeservice

#### 1. Define the state

For this state, we will simply only track the balance as a float.

```YAML
states:
  tracker: 
    type: keyed-state
    properties:
      key: 
        type: string
      value: 
        type: arrow-row
        properties:
          balance:
            type: f32
```

Here, the `key` is a string but the value is stored as an `arrow-row` which can contain multiple `properties`(acts like columns).

#### 2. Assign key
Like our previous example, we will use a trivial key to store the balance. 
```YAML
partition:
  assign-key:
    run: |
      fn map_cash(order: f32) -> Result<String> {
        Ok("cash".to_string())
      }
  update-state:
    (...)
```
#### 3. Updating State
To update the state in an `arrow-row`, we need to update the individual row's columns manual and call an `update()`. There is also available the `delete()` method that will remove the state for the current key.
```YAML
partition:
  assign-key:
    (...)
  update-state:
    run: |
      fn add_count(order: f32) -> Result<()> {
        let mut tracker = tracker();
        tracker.balance += order; 
        tracker.update()?;
        Ok(())
```

States are terminal so no other action will be run.

### Interface
The second service serves as a way to read from the state.

```YAML
interface:
  sources:
    - type: topic
      id: command
  states:
    tracker:
      from: mergeservice.tracker
  sinks:
    - type: topic
      id: message
      transforms:
        - operator: map 
          run: |
            fn new_input(_input: String) -> Result<String> {
              let track = tracker();
              let trackrow = sql(&format!("select * from tracker"))?;
              let rows = trackrow.rows()?;
              if !rows.next() {
                return Ok("empty".to_string())
              }
              let balancecol = trackrow.col("balance")?;
              let balance = rows.f32(&balancecol)?;
              Ok(format!("{:#?}",balance))
            }
```
The service first has to refer to the state created by the `mergeservice`. Inside the sink is the transform that will iterface with the state. For simplicity, whatever is sent to the source `command` will result in the service `message` outputting how much the balance is. For the transform function:
##### 1. We use a sql statement to read from `track`, a `LazyDf`.  
```
let trackrow = sql(&format!("select * from tracker"))?;
```
##### 2. Afterwards, we can select the column `balance`.
```
let rows = trackrow.rows()?;
if !rows.next() {
  return Ok("empty".to_string())
}
let balancecol = trackrow.col("balance")?;
let balance = rows.f32(&balancecol)?;
```


## Running the Example
### Full Code
Copy and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`.
<CodeBlock language="yaml">{Arrow}</CodeBlock>

### Running SDF
To run example:
```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf run
```

### Produce data
We will produce some data for the first service through the `buy` and `sell` topics. 
```bash copy="cmd"
$ echo '{"name":"AMZN","amount":20,"price":173.33}' | fluvio produce buy
$ echo '{"name":"TSLA","amount":20,"price":219.41}' | fluvio produce sell
```
Make sure the state exists by entering `show state` in sdf. It should have the following states:
```bash copy="cmd"
>> show state
 Namespace                                Keys  Type   
 (...)
 mergeservice/tracker/state               1     u32    
 (...)
```
And when running a `show state` on the that state
```bash copy="cmd"
>> show state mergeservice/tracker/state
 Key   Window  balance  
 cash  *       921.6001
```

### Consume data
Then lets send any string to `command` and consume the output found in `message`
```bash copy="cmd"
$ echo 'Do stuff' | fluvio produce command
$ fluvio consume message -Bd
921.6001
```

## Cleanup

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf clean --force
```


## Conclusion

We just implement example using arrow states. The following link contains another example with arrow-states.
