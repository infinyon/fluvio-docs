SDF has a tumbling window that collects entries from the source for a fixed duration of the window before finally being sent to the sink topic. For more in-depth explanation about windows, read [this][windows]. In this example, we will write a dataflow that aggregates the first digits of random numbers.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

## Dataflow
### Overview
In this example, we will write a dataflow that aggregates the first digits of random numbers. For windows, we need to implement states to store data. To read more about states, the following [page][state] shows information about states.

### Define a state

The following is a simple state using a key-value pair.
```YAML
states:
  count-by-first-digit:
    type: keyed-state
    properties:
      key: 
        type: string
      value:
        type: u32   
```

### Define a window

We will define a window with the following syntax
```YAML
    window: 
      tumbling: 
        (...)
      watermark:
        (...)
      assign-timestamp:
        (...)
      partition:
        assign-key:
          (...)
        transforms:
          (...)
        update-state:
          (...)
      flush:
        (...)
```

### Six components of a window

#### 1. Add Window duration
```YAML
tumbling: 
  duration: 15s
```
The above configuration sets the duration of the window to discrete 15 second blocks.

#### 2. Assigning an `idleness` time and `grace-period` (optional)

```YAML
watermark: 
  idleness: 60s
  grace-period: 3s
```

- `watermark.idleness: 60s`: This specifies that if there's no new data for 60 seconds, the window will be closed. This handles late-arriving events
- `watermark.grace-period: 3s`: This allows a 3 second grace period for out-of-order events. If an event arrives within this grace period after the window's end, it will still be included in the window's calculation. This prevents the dropping of slightly late events due to network delays or other factors.

#### 3. Assigning a timestamp

```YAML
assign-timestamp:
  run: | 
    fn assign_event_timestamp(_str: String, time: i64) -> Result<i64> {
      Ok(time)
    }
```
The above code assigns a timestamp to each of the entries from the source. In other cases, if a timestamp is encoded in the data, the code could also instead use the encoded timestamp.

#### 4. Assigning a partition key

```YAML
assign-key:
  run: |
    fn key_first_digit(str: String) -> Result<String> {
      if str.len() == 0 {
        return Ok("empty".to_string());
      }
      Ok(str[0..1].to_string())
    }
```
We need to make sure we have a mapping function that takes the string and maps it to a key. In this case, we are writing a dataflow that counts the number of occurance the first character appears in the window. Thus, the code just extracts the first digit as a key.

#### 5. Update the state

```YAML
update-state:
  run: |
    fn increment_digit_count(str: String) -> Result<()> {
      count_by_first_digit().increment(1);
      Ok(())
    }
```
To update the state, we have to call the object created by the state listed above. The `update-state` will automatically apply the state instance of the parameter. For our case, we call the increment function. Each time a string appears, the function will update the mapped key's value. In this case, the first digit.

#### 6. Flush the window

The final step is to flush the window. All the contents of the window gets popped and outputted into source.
```YAML
flush:
  run: |
    fn get_first_digit_count() -> Result<String> {
      let cc = count_by_first_digit().clone();
      Ok(cc.into_iter().map(|(digit, count)|
          format!("Numbers with {} occurred {} times,",digit,count)
      ).collect())
    }
```
In the example above, we copy the state object and iterate through the keys. A output(in this case a string) is created every time the window flushes. 

## Splitting the collected data

The above example collects all the data into one object. This could be sufficient for formats like JSON where information is together in one object. However, breaking up the aggregated data into a topic is also possible with a simple flat-map as seen with the example service `split-service`.

```YAML
transforms:
  - operator: flat-map
    run: |
      fn split(input: String) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
        let result: Vec<String> = input.split(',')
          .map(|s| s.to_string())
          .collect();
        Ok(result)
      }
```

Consuming the topic `sentence-start` will result in the individual entries neatly singled out in said topic.

## Running the Example

Copy and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`. The first `window-collect-service` is defined from the outlined five parts above. The second service is reference in splitting the collected data.

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{TumblingWindow}</CodeBlock>

To run example:
```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf run
```

Produce random numbers with the following bash script.

```bash copy="cmd"
while true; do
  random=$RANDOM
  echo "Random Number: $random"
  echo "$random" | fluvio produce sentences
  sleep 1  
done
```

Consume topic sink topic for the `digit-start-col` in another topic.

```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume digit-start-col -Bd
```

The output of the string is random, but should look something like this.
```
Numbers with 3 occurred 1 times,Numbers with 7 occurred 1 times,...
```
The output is a single entry in the sink topic.

Consuming the topic `digit-start` will result in something like the following
```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume digit-start -Bd
Numbers with 8 occurred 1 times
Numbers with 9 occurred 1 times
Numbers with 2 occurred 6 times
Numbers with 1 occurred 3 times
Numbers with 3 occurred 1 times
Numbers with 5 occurred 1 times
```
In this case, every 15 seconds a new set of records are added to the topic.

## Cleanup

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf clean --force
```

## Conclusion

We just implemented tumbling windows. Windows can be applied to applications needing aggregated data over a specified time window.
