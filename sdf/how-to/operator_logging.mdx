description: Logging within SDF operators using stdout and the `sdf log` command.

SDF operators can output logs using standard output (stdout), which can then be viewed using the [`sdf log`](../cli/log) command.  This allows developers to debug and monitor the behavior of their operators.

Within Rust operators, you can use the standard `println!` macro to write to stdout.  The output will be captured and displayed when you execute `sdf log`.

This is particularly useful for debugging and understanding the context in which your operator is running. You can, for example, print the key using [`key()`](../concepts/operator-context.mdx#key-function) or the window boundaries using [`window()`](../concepts/operator-context.mdx#window-function

).

## Example

```rust
fn add_count(input: String) -> Result<()> {
    if let Some(k) = key() {
        println!("Key: {:?}", k); // Print the key if it exists
    }

    let (window_start, window_end) = window();
    println!("Window start timestamp: {}, Window end timestamp: {}", window_start, window_end);

    let new_value = counter().increment(1);
    println!("New counter value: {}", new_value);

    Ok(())
}
