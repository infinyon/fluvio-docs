This tutorial is for using states. We will use states in this example to write a simple dataflow that counts the number of entries sent to a topic. The following [page][states] contains an indepth explanation about states.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

## Dataflow

### Overview
We will define a service that contains a state which counts how much entries have entered the source.

### Service With State
In this section we will show how to write a dataflow with a primitive state. The service needs to include a `state` and a `partition`. Inside the state, we will define a key-value pair. For our case, we are only using a primitive key-value pair(`String -> u32`). Inside the `partition`, we will define an `assign-key` and `update-state`. The function in `assign-key` will take the input from the source and map it to a key. The function in `update-state` will define the logic how the state is updated.

```YAML
count-service:
  sources:
    - type: topic
      id: sentences
  states:
    (...)
  partition:
    assign-key:
      (...)
    update-state:
      (...)
```

#### 1. State definition
For our example, we defined a simple key-value pair. 
```YAML
states:
  counter: 
    type: keyed-state
    properties:
      key: 
        type: string
      value:
        type: u32  
```
#### 2. Assign key
In our state, we have to map inputs to a key in our state. But for our example, our mapping function is trivial. All inputs are mapped to the same output. In most other cases, you can modify the mapping to take on more complicated logic.
```YAML
assign-key:
  run: |
    fn map_count(input: String) -> Result<String> {
      Ok("counter".to_string())
    }
```
#### 3. Updating State
The following part of the dataflow defines how the value of the mapped function is updated. In our case, all we want to do is increment the counter by 1. Because the way we assigned our key, all inputs will increment the same key.
```YAML
run: |
  fn add_count(input: String) -> Result<()> {
    counter().increment(1);
    Ok(())
  }
```

## Running the Example

Copy and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`.

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{StateExample}</CodeBlock>

To run example:
```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf run
```

### Produce data
You can produce data to the `sentence` topic via
```bash copy="cmd"
$ echo 'hello' | fluvio produce sentences
$ echo 'hello' | fluvio produce sentences
$ echo 'hello' | fluvio produce sentences
```
It does not matter the input as the dataflow only counts entries.

### Consume data
You can see how much entries have entered sentences through using sdf's CI
```bash copy="cmd"
>> show state count-service/counter/state 
 Key      Window  Value 
 counter  *       3   
```

## Cleanup

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf clean --force
```


## Conclusion

We just implement another example with states.
