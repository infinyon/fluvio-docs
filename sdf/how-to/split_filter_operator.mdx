# Split Filter Map Operator

The `Split Filter` is an operator used to selectively filter out what entries enter what sinks. The `Split Filter` is useful when wanting to sort entries into multiple sinks. For this example, we will refer to the example for the [filter operator][filter]. We will map strings from the `topic` sentences to sink topics `question` and `not-question`. The following visual shows how the service interacts with a single source to two sinks.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

## Transformation

The general syntax follows from the [filter operator's][filter] transform but is instead embedded with the sinks. 
```YAML
sinks:
  - type: topic
    id: (...)
    transforms:
      - operator: filter
        run: |
          (... filter function ...)
    (... more topics ...)
```
In our case, the function takes a string as input, but will always return a boolean value.  If the input string contains a question mark, the operator will return `true`.  Otherwise, it will return `false`.

```YAML
sinks:
  - type: topic
    id: question
    transforms:
      - operator: filter
        run: |
          fn filter_question(sentence: String) -> Result<bool>{
            Ok(sentence.contains("?"))
          }
  - type: topic
    id: not-question
    transforms:
      - operator: filter
        run: |
          fn filter_not_question(sentence: String) -> Result<bool>{
            Ok(!sentence.contains("?"))
          }
```

## Running the Example

Copy and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`.


<CodeBlock language="yaml">{SplitFilter}</CodeBlock>

To run example:
```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf run --ephemeral
```

Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ echo "Hello world" | fluvio produce sentences
$ echo "Are you there?" | fluvio produce sentences
```

Consume topic `question` to retrieve the result in another terminal:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume question -Bd
Are you there?
```

Consume the other topic `not-question`
```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume not-question -Bd
Hello world
```

Instead of one topic with only questions, we see that both topics are sent to sinks.


## Cleanup

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf clean --force
```


## Conclusion

In this example, we covered how to use split traffic with the filter operator. While quite similar to the filter transform, using it as a split operator may allow for easier code.
