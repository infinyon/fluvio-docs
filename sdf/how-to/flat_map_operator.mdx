# FlatMap Operator

The Flat-Map Operator allows an input from the source to be split into multiple entries in the sink. Because it is a map operator, split inputs can be mapped too. However, unlike a map operator, it creates a one to many mapping. Its a powerful tool that could be used to digest arrays, objects, or other nested data.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

## Syntax

Below is an example of a tranform function using flat-map. The function takes the string and splits in half. Both halves are inserted into the sink.  

```YAML
    transforms:
      - operator: flat-map
        run: |
          fn halfword(input: String) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
            let mut ret: Vec<String> = Vec::new();
            let mid = input.len() / 2;
            ret.push(format!("first half: {}",&input[..mid]));
            ret.push(format!("second half: {}",&input[mid..]));
            Ok(ret)
          }
```
In the example function, the return type is a vector of strings. The split string is re-encoded. In general, the transform function should return a vector of the sink's type.

## Running the Example

Copy and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`.


<CodeBlock language="yaml">{FlatMap}</CodeBlock>

To run example:
```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf run --ephemeral
```

Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ echo "0123456789" | fluvio produce sentences
```

Consume topic `halfword` to retrieve the result in another terminal:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume halfword -Bd
first half: 01234
second half: 56789
```
Here two strings are produced from the input.

## Cleanup

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf clean --force
```


## Conclusion

We just covered another basic operator in SDF, the Flat-Map Operator.
