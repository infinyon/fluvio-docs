# `sdf run`

The `sdf run` command executes a dataflow in the same process as the CLI.  The command expects a `dataflow.yaml` file in the current directory.
The command loads the dataflow, compiles all components, and starts a process to run the dataflow —all artifacts are stored in the `.sdf` directory and should not be manually changed.

After provisioning the command enters an [interactive shell] that allows you to interact with the dataflow.

[interactive shell]: #run-interactive-shell

### `sdf run` command

The `run` command has several options:

```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf run -h
Run dataflow (requires: dataflow.yaml)

Usage: sdf run [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --ui
          Start Development Studio [env: UI=]
  -p, --port <PORT>
          Port for web server to listen on [env: PORT=] [default: 8000]
  -e, --env <ENV_LIST>
          (Optional) environment variables to be passed to each operator They
          should be passed using key=value format Eg. sdf run -e foo=bar -e
          key=value -e one=1
      --skip-running
          when set, it will skip running the service
      --build-profile <BUILD_PROFILE>
          [default: release]
      --prod
          set runtime to use production mode this will disable dev configurations [env: PROD=]
      --force-update
          Force update
```

Where:
* `--ui` start graphical representation of the project in a web browser. The default port is `8000`.
* `--port` sets the port for the web server to listen on
* `--env` sets environment variables to be passed to operators
* `--skip-running` - compiles components and exists without running the dataflow
* `--build-profile` - sets the build profile
* `--prod` - sets runtime to apply prod specific parameters
* `--force-update` - forces the update of the project dependencies

In addition, the `run` command opens interactive shell.


### `run` interactive shell

The interactive shell allows you to look-up runtime object, such as state.

```bash copy="fl"
>> help
SDF - Stateful Dataflow

Usage: <COMMAND>

Commands:
  show  Show or List states. Use `show state --help` for more info
  sql   Start sql mode
  exit  Stop interactive session
  help  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

#### `show state`

Show states or show state for given namespace and key.

```bash copy="fl"
>> show state -h
List all states or show state for given key

Usage: show state [OPTIONS] [NAMESPACE]

Arguments:
  [NAMESPACE]  namespace of state

Options:
      --key <KEY>        key of state
      --filter <FILTER>  filter regex
```

Where:
* `--key` and `--filter` refines the result.

#### Examples

##### Run command

Navigate to the directory with `dataflow.yaml` file, and run the command:

```bash
$ sdf run
```

The command generates all components required and starts a process to run the dataflow.


##### Show all available objects

Use the default command to show objects:

```bash copy="fl"
>> show state
 Namespace                                Keys  Type
 filter-service/sentences/metrics         1     table
 filter-service/filter-questions/metrics  1     table
 filter-service/sentences/topic.offset    1     offset
```

#### Show state for a key

Show the detailed information:

```bash copy="fl"
>> show state filter-service/filter-questions/metrics
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       2          0
```

#### SQL mode

Please see the section of [sql mode].
