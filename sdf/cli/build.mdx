# `sdf build`

The `sdf build` uses a `sdf-package.yaml` file to detect the structure of a project previously generated with [sdf generate] and then build it.

### `sdf build` command

The `build` command has the following hierarchy:

```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf build -h
Build package (requires: sdf-package.yaml)

Usage: sdf build [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --dev   set runtime to use dev mode [env: DEV=]
  -h, --help  Print help
```

Where:
* `--dev` development profile to be used for runtime mode

#### Examples

In case of success, the build command is silent:

```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf build
```
