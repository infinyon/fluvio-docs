# `sdf deploy`

The `sdf deploy` command executes a dataflow in the worker. 

After provisioning, the command enters an [interactive shell] that allows you to interact with the dataflow.

[interactive shell]: #deploy-interactive-shell

### `sdf deploy` command

The `deploy` command has several options:

```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf deploy -h
Run dataflow (requires: dataflow.yaml)

Usage: sdf deploy [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --ui
          Start Development Studio [env: UI=]
  -p, --port <PORT>
          Port for web server to listen on [env: PORT=] [default: 8000]
  -e, --env <ENV_LIST>
          (Optional) environment variables to be passed to each operator They should be
          passed using key=value format Eg. sdf run -e foo=bar -e key=value -e one=1
      --skip-dataflow
          
      --timeout <TIMEOUT>
          timeout in seconds [env: TIMEOUT=] [default: 60]
```

Where:
* `--ui` starts graphical representation of the project in a web browser. The default port is `8000`.
* `--port` sets the port for the web server to listen on
* `--env` sets environment variables to be passed to operators
* `--skip-dataflow` skips deploying the dataflow in the current directory.


Once deployment is complete, the `deploy` command opens interactive shell to worker.


### `deploy` interactive shell

The interactive shell allows you to look-up runtime objects, such as stat

```bash copy="fl"
>> help

  select
