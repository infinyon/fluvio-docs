# `sdf log`

The `sdf logs` prints the logs of dataflow operators on ephemeral workers.

### `sdf logs` command

The `logs` command has the following hierarchy:

```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf logs -h
Print dataflow logs

Usage: sdf log [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -f, --follow  Specify if the logs should be streamed
  -h, --help    Print help
```

Where:
* `--follow` causes the command to not stop when end of file is reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the log file
