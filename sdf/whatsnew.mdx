# Beta 4

## Upgrading 

To upgrade CLI to the beta4, run the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{InstallFvm}</CodeBlock>

To upgrade host workers, shutdown and restart the worker:

```bash
$ sdf worker shutdown <host-worker-name>
$ sdf worker create <host-worker-name>
```

For upgrading cloud workers, please contact [InfinyOn support](#infinyon-support).

### Compatibility and Breaking changes


### CLI changes

- `sdf run` not longer accepts `--dev` as it is the default. In order to use `sdf run` in non development mode, use `--prod`. 

### Improvements

- Added [sql mode] to interactive shell.
- Added capability to run complex queries like join on states in operator context through the [sql function].

### Changes
- Replaced dashes in tables. Previously, when the state name has dashes in it, we were escaping the state name in sql context with quotes. From sdf-beta5, we should access them using `_` instead of `-` on the table name in order to avoid the escaping.
