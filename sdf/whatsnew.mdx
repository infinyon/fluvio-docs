## Upgrading 

To upgrade CLI to this version, run the following command:

```

### Improvements

- Improve error output for some of the yaml parsing errors.
- Do not require `type-name` in list type
- Avoid generating invalid WIT names
- Use dev runtime by default on `sdf test`
- Add validation to check if pkg namespace/name conflicts with df

### Changes

- Make types respect casing defined on yaml for deserialization and serialization when using `apiVersion: 0.6.0`
