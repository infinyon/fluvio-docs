# Beta 3

## Upgrading 

To upgrade CLI to the beta3, run the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{InstallFvm}</CodeBlock>

To upgrade host workers, shutdown and restart the worker:

```bash
$ sdf worker shutdown <host-worker-name>
$ sdf worker create <host-worker-name>
```

For upgrading cloud workers, please contact [InfinyOn support](#infinyon-support).

### Compatibility and Breaking changes


### CLI changes
- `sdf worker list` now performs workers version check by default

### Package migration

We suggest to regenerate the packages again and copy the operator logic in the new generated file, to include the package generated code improvements.

## New Features

- Support connecting to other fluvio cluster topics via profile. See how to access external clusters in [topics configuration].

## Improvements
- Support `sdf cleanup` in packages.
- Improvements on SDF packages.

## Bug Fixes
- Sdf dataflow properly terminates in host worker.
