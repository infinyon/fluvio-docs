# SDF Beta 11 Release Notes

We're excited to announce **SDF Beta 11**! This release brings several improvements and new features designed to give you more control and better insights into your data.

---

## Upgrading to Beta 11

To upgrade CLI to this version, run the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{InstallFvm}</CodeBlock>

To upgrade local (host) workers, shutdown and restart the worker:

```bash
$ sdf worker shutdown <host-worker-name>
$ sdf worker create <host-worker-name>
```

For upgrading Infinyon Cloud (remote) workers run `fluvio cloud sdf version sdf-beta11` or contact [InfinyOn support](#infinyon-support).

### New Features & Improvements

- Row State delete() API: You can now easily delete specific rows from your state values, giving you finer control over your data.
- _updated_at Column for DataFrames: All DataFrames now include a new _updated_at column. This provides a timestamp indicating the last time each row was updated, allowing you to track data freshness.
- Time-to-Live (TTL) for Row State: Configure [TTL] for row state values to automatically purge rows that haven't been updated within a specified time. This helps you manage data lifecycle and reduce stale data.
- MCP Server Integration: We've integrated the [MCP server] into SDF, enhancing internal communication and system stability.
