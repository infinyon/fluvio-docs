# Beta 2

## Upgrading 

To upgrade to the beta2, run the following command:

```bash
$ fvm install sdf-beta2
```

For upgrading cloud workers, please contact InfinyOn support. 

### Compatibility and Breaking changes

V4 of dataflow is no longer supported. Please upgrade to V5.
Beta2 CLI is not compatible with Beta1 workers.  Please upgrade workers to Beta2.

### Package migration

Since beta2, the packages functions are consolidated in a single rust crate on generation. This allows us to share types and logic between different package functions.

In order to migrate your existing packages, you need to generate your package (`sdf generate`) using the `sdf-beta2` version and then copy the code in the new location of the generated code.

In other words, for each function, the logic in `rust/<function-name>/src/lib.rs` must be copied on `rust/<package-name>/src/<function_name>.rs`. But please, make sure that all the attributes in `#[sdf]` attribute macro matches with the attributes that we get on code generation.
