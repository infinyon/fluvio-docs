# Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

# Introduction

The Filter Operator is a powerful tool that allows you to filter messages based on a condition.  It is a simple operator that takes a single input and returns a boolean value.  If the input meets the condition, the operator will return `true`.  Otherwise, it will return `false`.

# Syntax

Here is a simple filter operator.  It takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.  If the input string contains a question mark, the operator will return `true`.  Otherwise, it will return `false`.

```YAML
    transforms:
      - operator: filter
        run: |
          fn filter_questions(input: String) -> Result<bool> {
            Ok(input.contains("?"))
          }

```

# Running the Example

Coyp and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import Filter from '!!raw-loader!./dataflows/filter.yaml';

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{Filter}</CodeBlock>


To run example:
```bash
$ sdf run --ephemeral
```

Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio produce sentence
```

Consume topic `questions` to retrieve the result in another terminal:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume questions
```

Product the following sentences:
```bash
Hello world
Are you there?
```

You should only see message that contains a question mark:
```bash
Are you there?
```

# Conclusion

We just covered one of the most basic operators in SDF, the Filter Operator.  Combining with other basic operators, you can build more complex dataflows to process your data.
