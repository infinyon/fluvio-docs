The Filter Operator is a powerful tool that allows you to filter messages based on a condition.  It is a simple operator that takes a single input and returns a boolean value.  If the input meets the condition, the operator will return `true`.  Otherwise, it will return `false`.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

## Syntax

Here is a simple filter operator.  It takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.  If the input string contains a question mark, the operator will return `true`.  Otherwise, it will return `false`.

```YAML
    transforms:
      - operator: filter
        run: |
          fn filter_questions(input: String) -> Result<bool> {
            Ok(input.contains("?"))
          }

```

## Running the Example

Copy and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`.


<CodeBlock language="yaml">{Filter}</CodeBlock>

To run example:
```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf run --ephemeral
```

Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ echo "Hello world" | fluvio produce sentences
$ echo "Are you there?" | fluvio produce sentences
```

Consume topic `questions` to retrieve the result in another terminal:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume questions -Bd
Are you there?
```

Only questions are returned.


## Cleanup

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash
sdf clean --force
```


## Conclusion

We just covered one of the most basic operators in SDF, the Filter Operator.  Combining with other basic operators, you can build more complex dataflows to process your data.
