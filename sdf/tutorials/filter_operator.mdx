# Introduction

The Filter Operator is a powerful tool that allows you to filter messages based on a condition. This tutorial will show you how to use the Filter Operator to filter messages from a topic.

# Operator Overview

Here is a simple filter operator.  It takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.  If the input string contains a question mark, the operator will return `true`.  Otherwise, it will return `false`.

```YAML
    transforms:
      - operator: filter
        run: |
          fn filter_questions(input: String) -> Result<bool> {
            Ok(input.contains("?"))
          }

```
