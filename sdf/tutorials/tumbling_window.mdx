SDF has a tumbling window that collects entries from the source for a fixed duration of the window before finally being sent to the sink topic. For more in-depth explanation about windows, read [this][windows].

## Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions at [here][installation].

## States

To read more about states, the following [page][state] shows information about states.

### Define a state

The following is a primitive state taking using key-value pair.
```YAML
    states:
      count-by-first-letter:
        type: keyed-state
        properties:
          key: 
            type: string
          value:
            type: u32
```

### Define a window

We will define a window with the following syntax
```YAML
    window: 
      tumbling: 
        (...)
      assign-timestamp:
        (...)
      partition:
        assign-key:
          (...)
        update-state:
          (...)
      flush:
        (...)
```
### Five components
#### Window duration
```YAML
tumbling: 
  duration: 15s
```
The following sets the duration of the window to discrete 15 second blocks.
#### Timestamping
```YAML
assign-timestamp:
  run: | 
    fn assign_event_timestamp(_str: String, time: i64) -> Result<i64> {
      Ok(time)
    }
```
The above code assigns a timestamp to each of the entries from the source. In other cases, if a timestamp is encoded in the data, the code could also use the encoded timestamp.
#### Assigning a key
```YAML
assign-key:
  run: |
    fn key_first_character(str: String) -> Result<String> {
      if str.len() == 0 {
        return Ok("empty".to_string());
      }
      Ok(str[0..1].to_string())
    }
```
We need to make sure we have a mapping function that takes the string and maps it to some key. In this case, we are writing a dataflow that counts the number of occurance the first character appears in the window. Thus, the code just extracts the first character as a key.

#### Updating the state
```YAML
update-state:
  run: |
    fn increment_color_count(str: String) -> Result<()> {
      // Note: The instead of dashes, the function uses underscores instead.
      count_by_first_letter().increment(1);
      Ok(())
    }
```
To update the state, we have to call the object created by the state listed above. The `update-state` will automatically apply the state instance of the parameter. For our case, we call the increment function. Each time a string appears, the function will update the mapped key's value. 

#### Flushing the window
The final step is to flush the window. All the contents of the window gets popped and outputted into source.
```YAML
flush:
  run: |
    fn get_first_character_count() -> Result<String> {
      let cc = count_by_first_letter().clone();
      Ok(cc.into_iter().map(|(letter, count)|
          format!("Sentences with {} occured {} times,",letter,count)
      ).collect())
    }
```
In the example above, we copy the state object and iterate through the keys. A output(in this case a string) is created every time the window flushes. 

## Running the Example

Copy and paste following config and save it as `dataflow.yaml`. The first `window-collect-service` is defined from the outlined five parts above. The second service is reference in splitting the collected data.


<CodeBlock language="yaml">{TumblingWindow}</CodeBlock>

To run example:
```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf run --ephemeral
```

Produce random sentences with the following bash script.

```bash copy="cmd"
while true; do
  random=$(openssl rand -base64 12)
  echo "Random String: $random"
  echo "$random" | fluvio produce sentences
  sleep 1  
done
```

Consume topic sink topic for the `sentence-start-col` in another topic.

```bash copy="cmd"
$ fluvio consume sentence-start-col -Bd
```

The output of the string is random, but should look something like this.
```
Sentences with e occured 1 times,...
```
The output is a single entry in the sink topic.

## Splitting the collected data
The above example collects all the data into one object. This could be sufficient for formats like JSON where information is together in one object. However, breaking up the aggregated data into a topic is also possible with a simple flat-map as seen with the example service `split-service`.

```YAML
transforms:
  - operator: flat-map
    run: |
      fn split(input: String) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
        let result: Vec<String> = input.split(',')
                              .map(|s| s.to_string())
                              .collect();
        Ok(result)
      }
```

Consuming the topic `sentence-start` will result in the individual entries neatly singled out in said topic.

## Cleanup

Exit `sdf` terminal and clean-up. The `--force` flag removes the topics:

```bash copy="cmd"
$ sdf clean --force
```


## Conclusion

We just how to implement tumbling windows.
