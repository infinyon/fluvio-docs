Services define the dataflow composition and the business logic. The composition is determinted via `sources` and the `sinks`, and the business logic and the internal state by the `transforms` and the `states`.

## Overview

Services can be molded to perform various operations, such as traffic routing, transformations, and window processing. We'll start with a brief overview of the architecture, followed by the service definition template, and conclude with several service definition examples for:

* [Simple Transformations](#simple-tranformations)
* [Data Routing with Merge and Split](#data-routing-with-merge-and-split)
* [Parallel Processing with Partitions](#parallel-processing-with-partitions)
* [Window Processing](#window-processing)

## Service Architecture

Services are dataflow paths designed to perform one chain of operations in sequence. For example, the engine allows services to receive events from multiple sources and send their output to multiple sinks but restricts the `transforms` operations to execute sequentially.

Inside transforms, the engine sends the output of one operator to the input of the next operator, as defined in the dataflow file.

The only parallelism allowed is through `partitions` as described in the [Partition section](#parallel-processing-with-partitions) below.

Furthermore, [window processing] services are dedicated services that play a specific role in the dataflow implementation. They start the `window` keyword and perform pre-defined operations such as: `assign-timestamp`, `partition`, and `flush`. These services aim to create a state object that can be sent to a topic or referenced by other services.

[window processing]: #window-processing

## Services Template Definition

Services are defined in the [dataflow.yaml] file and it has the following hierarchy:

```yaml
services:
  <service-name>:
    sources:
      -type: topic
       id: <topic-name>
        transforms:
          - operator: <operator-props>

    states:
      <state-name>: <state-definition> | <state-reference>

    transforms:
      - operator: <operator-props>

    window:
      <window-props>

    partition:
      <partition-props>

    sinks:
      -type: topic
       id: <topic-name>
        transforms:
          - operator: <operator-props>
```

Where:

 - **sources** - has one or more references to topics, with an optional tranformation. Checkout the [merge] section for examples on multiple sources.
 - **states** - has `definitions` for objects managed by the services, and `references` to an external object. Checkout the [states] section for additional information.
 - **transforms** - define the operators to be applied to the data.
 - **window** - defines the window processing parameters. Checkout [window section] below for additional information.
 - **partition** - defines the parallelism of the transforms. Checkout [partition section] below for additional information.
 - **sinks** - could be zero or multiples references to topics, with an optional tranformation. Checkout the [split] section for examples on multiple destinations.

[partition section]: #parallel-processing-with-partitions

## Services - Sample Use Cases

Services are like Lego; you can stitch them together in multiple ways to cover a high number of use cases. This section describes several use cases that should give you a better understanding on how to archiect your own dataflow.

### Simple Tranformations

One of the simplest forms of services is a chain of operators that perform data transformations.

#### Inline Definition

In this example, we'll define a service that translates sentences into words and count the number of characters in each word.

```yaml
services:
  sentence-words:
    sources:
      - type: topic
        id: sentence

    transforms:
      - operator: flat-map
        run: |
          fn sentence_to_words(sentence: String) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
            Ok(sentence.split_whitespace().map(String::from).collect())
          }
      - operator: map
        run: |
          pub fn augment_count(word: String) -> Result<String> {
            Ok(format!("{}({})", word, word.chars().count()))
          }

    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: words
```

The service listens for events from a `sentence` topic, runs a `flat-map` operator `sentence_to_words` to split the sentence into words, and returns the result in an array of words. The engine passes the words to a `map` operator `augment_count` that counts the number of characters and appends the value to the word. After all transformations are completed, the result is sent to the `words` topic.

We defined the code inline for simplicity, but we could have placed it in a package and imported it from there.

#### Composition Definition

With composition, we build our code in packages, and import them into the dataflow file:

```yaml
imports:
  - pkg: example/sentence-pkg@0.1.0
    functions:
      - name: sentence-to-words
      - name: augment-count

services:
  sentence-words:
    sources:
      - type: topic
        id: sentence

    transforms:
      - operator: flat-map
        uses: sentence-to-words

      - operator: map
        uses: augment-count

    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: words
```

Packages allow you to write and test your code in your favorite editor instead of the yaml. During development, you can import the package locally, and in production, you can publish and import from InfinyOn Hub.

Check out the [dataflow.yaml] and [sdf-package.yaml] sections for additional information.


### Data Routing with Merge and Split

It is often desirable to merge traffic from multiple topics or split the traffic into many topics. Some examples are splitting good and bad records,dividing user activity based on cohort or geo-location, or merging two datasets of similar properties. The dataflow can easily handle such scenarios.

#### Merge

For example, the following service definition merges traffic from the `child` and `adult` topics to the `people` topic:

```yaml
services:
  merge-service:
    sources:
      - type: topic
        id: child
      - type: topic
        id: adult

    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: people
```

While `sources` and `sinks` allow for transformations, the formats in our example data match, so we are set.


#### Split

The following service definition splits the traffic from the `people` topic to the `child` and `adult` topics:

```yaml
services:
  split-service:
    sources:
      - type: topic
        id: people

    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: child
        transforms:
          - operator: filter
            run: |
              fn is_child(person: Person) -> Result<bool> {
                  Ok(person.age < 18)
              }
      - type: topic
        id: adult
        transforms:
          - operator: filter
            run: |
              fn is_adult(person: Person) -> Result<bool> {
                  Ok(person.age >= 18)
              }
```

Generally, the engine sends the records to all matching topics. However, in this example, we'll use the `filter` operator to choose which record should be sent to the `child` and `adult` topics.

Check out the [merge] and [split] sections for additional information.


### Parallel Processing with Partitions

Partitions give you the ability to divide the data in sets and process each data set in parallel.

<img src="/img/sdf/service-partitions.png" alt="Service Partitions" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} width="720" />

Say you have a stream of `sentences` where you want to count the occurrences of each word in all sentences. Partitioning helps to solve this problem by assigning a partition key to each `word` and incremeting each partition independently.

Partitions improve performance by processing records in parallel, and it also makes the custom code straightforward to write.

```yaml
services:
  transforms:
    - operator: flat-map
      run: |
        fn split_sequence(sentence: String) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
          Ok(sentence.split_whitespace().map(String::from).collect())
        }
  partition:
    assign-key:
      run: |
        fn key_by_word(word: String) -> Result<String> {
          Ok(word.to_lowercase().chars().filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric()).collect())
        }

    update-state:
      run: |
        fn increment_word_count(_word: String) -> Result<()> {
          let mut state = count_per_word();
          state.count += 1;
          state.update();
          Ok(())
        }
```

In this example, we use the `flat-map` operator to split the sentences into words and a `partition` section to group records by key. Inside `partition`, we use the `assign-key` operator to indicate the location of the key, and `update-state` operator to increment the count for each word.

**Partition Requirements**

* The `assign-key` and `transforms` fields are mandatory.
* The chain of operation in `transforms` must end with `update-state.`

### Window Processing

Window processing converts unbounded streams of records into bounded data sets suitable for counting, trend analysis, anomaly detection, data collection for dashboards and tables, materialized views, etc. Under the hood, Fluvio converts records into [Apache Arrow format] for fast and convenient access via third-party libraries such as [Polars].

<img src="/img/sdf/service-window.png" alt="Window Processing"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} width="740" />

In this section we'll expand on the previous example by adding a window operator to count the top most used words in span of 20 seconds.

```yaml
services:
  window:
    tumbling:
      duration: 20s

    assign-timestamp:
      run: |
        fn assign_event_timestamp(_value: String, event_time: i64) -> Result<i64> {
          Ok(event_time)
        }

    partition:
      assign-key:
        run: |
          fn assign_word_key(word: String) -> Result<String> {
            Ok(word.to_lowercase().chars().filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric()).collect())
          }

      update-state:
        run: |
          fn increment_word_count(word: String) -> Result<()> {
            count_per_word().increment(1);
            Ok(())
            }

    flush:
      run: |
        fn compute_most_used_words() -> Result<TopWords> {
          let mut top3 = count_per_word().clone();
          top3.sort_by(|a, b| a.value.cmp(&b.value));
          top3.reverse();
          top3.truncate(3);
          Ok(top3.iter().map( | entry | WordCount { word: entry.key.clone(), count: entry.value }).collect())
        }
```

In this example, we use the `window` operator to convert the stream of words into a `tumbling` windowed data set that flushes every 20 seconds.

**Window Processing Requirements**

* The `assign-timestamp` operator to tell the engine which field to use for the timestamp. In this example, we use the `event_time` field from the record. For additional context, check out the [timestamp operator section].
* The `partition` operator to group records by key (optional).
* The `update-state` operator to update the state on each record.
* The `flush` operator returns the full data set for processing. The engine triggers the `flush operation` when the window closes, every 20 seconds.
