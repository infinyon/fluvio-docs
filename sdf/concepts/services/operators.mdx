**Operators** are APIs that enable developers to customize their data applications. The operators have opinionated function signatures and flexible types. Some operators can be used independently, whereas others must be chained to accomplish the task.

#### Summary

The engine implements `transforms` operators chained in an array inside a transforms section and `named` operators following a hierarchical convention.

The [tranforms operators](#transforms-operators) are:

* [map](#map)
* [filter](#filter)
* [filter-map](#filter-map)
* [flat-map](#flat-map)

The [named operators](#named-operators) are:

* [assign-timestamp](#assign-timestamp)
* [assign-key](#assign-key)
* [update-state](#update-state)
* [flush](#flush)

The engine also uses [keyword operators](#keyword-operators) to identify a multi-step operation:

* [partition](#partition)
* [window](#window)

Let's take a look at each operator in detail.


## Transforms Operators

The `transforms` section is an array that allows multiple operators to be chained and perform composite operations.

### `map`

The `map` operator takes an input record, applies a transformation, and forwards the modified record to the next operator.

For example, given an user record, you can mask their social security number with the following `map` operation:

```yaml
transforms:
  - operator: map
    run: |
      fn mask_ssn(user: User) -> Result<User> {
        let mut u = user.clone();
        u.ssn = u.ssn.replace(|c: char| c.is_digit(10), "*");
        Ok(u)
      }
```

### `filter`

The `filter` operator takes a record and returns a boolean that tells the engine whether to drop it or forward it to the next operator:

  * `true` - foward the record to the next operator.
  * `false` - drop the record.

While in most cases, one operator's output becomes the next operator's input; the `filter` operation works differently. The operator returns a boolean to control the state, and the engine then sends the record to the next operator.

The following example defines a `filter` that drops all sentences without a question mark:

```yaml
transforms:
  - operator: filter
    run: |
      fn filter_questions(input: String) -> Result<bool> {
        Ok(input.contains("?"))
      }
```

Check out [filter example in github] for a working demo.


### `filter-map`

The `filter-map` operator combines a filter and a map operation; it takes a record and returns a modified record or none. The return value tells the engine to forward the records to the next operator or to drop them:

  * `Some(Record)` - foward the record to the next operator.
  * `None` - drop the record.

The following example defines a `filter-map` that transforms sentences longer than ten characters to uppercase and drops all others:

```yaml
transforms:
  - operator: filter-map
    run: |
      fn long_sentence_to_uppercase(input: String) -> Result<Option<String>> {
        if input.len() > 10 {
          Ok(Some(input.to_uppercase()))
        } else {
          Ok(None)
        }
      }
```

### `flat-map`

The `flat-map` operator takes an aggregate record and returns an array of records. The engine reads the array and sends individual records, one at a time, to the next operator.

The following example defines a `flat-map` that splits sentences into words:

```yaml
transforms:
  - operator: flat-map
    run: |
      fn split_sentence(sentence: String) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
        Ok(sentence.split_whitespace().map(String::from).collect())
      }
```

Check out [flat-map example in github] for a working demo.

## Named Operators

Named operators are pre-pended by a keyword that identifies the operator's function. The keywords are defined in the next section.

### `assign-timestamp`

The `assign-timestamp` operator lets you choose a timestamp for window processing. Timestamps help the engine distributed records to windows. The timestamp may be defined from the record metadata or from the record value.

##### Assign timestamp from record metadata

The following example shows how to update the timestamp from the record metadata, passed down through the `event_time` field:

```yaml
assign-timestamp:
  run: |
    fn assign_timestamp(_sentence: String, event_time: i64) -> Result<i64> {
      Ok(event_time)
    }
```

Check out [word-counter example in github] for a working demo.


##### Assign timestamp from record value

Assuming an user_event record has a `timestamp` field, the following example shows how to update the timestamp from the record value:

```yaml
assign-timestamp:
  run: |
    fn assign_timestamp(user_event: UserEvent, _event_time: i64) -> Result<i64> {
      Ok(user_event.timestamp)
    }
```

The `assign_timestamp` operation is mandatory in window processing


### `assign-key`

The `assign-key` operation assigns a key to the record metadata. The engine uses the key to determine which records to group in the same partition.

The following example shows how the assign-key operator groups cars by their color:

```yaml
assign-key:
  run: |
    fn key_by_color(car: Car) -> Result<String> {
      Ok(car.color)
    }
```

Check out [car-count example in github] for a working demo.

### `update-state`

The `update-state` operator informs engine that a state object update is imminent, and this is the last step for the service.

The following example shows how the `update-state` operator updates the state object `temperature()` with the latest temperature value:

```yaml
update-state:
  run: |
    fn update_temperature(event: Temp) -> Result<()> {
      let mut temp = temperature();
      temp.sensor = event.sensor;
      temp.temperature = event.temperature;
      temp.update()?;
      Ok(())
    }
```

Check out [update-state example in github] for a working demo.


### `flush`

The `flush` operator is the final stage of a window processing service. The engine invokes flush after the watermark closes the window. The flush API is expected to return a value passed to the sink.

Assuming a window operator that generates a state object that counts car colors, the following example shows how the `flush` operator returns a list of colors and their counts:

```yaml
flush:
  run: |
    fn get_car_color_count() -> Result<CarColors> {
      let cc = count_by_color().clone();
      Ok(cc.into_iter().map(|(color, count)|
        Color {
          color,
          count
          }
        ).collect())
    }
```

## Keyword Operators

Keyword operators wrap a hierarchy of operation under its name. The keyword operators are: `partition` and `window`.


### `partition`

The `partition` operation divides the stream into data sets that are processed in parallel. Each partition will have its own state. The partition operation has the following sub-sections:

* [assign-key](#assign-key)
* [transforms](#transforms-operators)
* [update-state](#update-state)

Assign-key is mandatory, whereas `tranforms` and `update-state` are optional, but at least one of them is required.

The following example shows how the `partition` operation divides the stream into words and updates the state object `count_per_word()` with the latest word count:

```yaml
partition:
  assign-key:
    run: |
      fn assign_word_key(word: String) -> Result<String> {
        Ok(word.to_lowercase().chars().filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric()).collect())
      }

  update-state:
    run: |
      fn increment_word_count(word: String) -> Result<()> {
        count_per_word().increment(1);
        Ok(())
      }
```

### `window`

The `window` operation turns streams of records into finite groups of records captured based on the window size. The window operation is a multi-state operation with the following sub-section:

* [assign-timestamp](#assign-timestamp)
* [partition](#partition)
* [assign-key](#assign-key)
* [update-state](#update-state)
* [flush](#flush)

While there are several types of windows, and the engine will eventually implement all of them, the first version supports tumbling window. A `tumbling window` is a window that is continuous and non-overlapping.

Building on the example above, a tumbling window of 20 seconds that computes the top 3 words in a stream of sentences has the following hierarchy:

```yaml
window:
  tumbling:
    duration: 20s

  assign-timestamp:
    run: |
      fn assign_event_timestamp(_value: String, event_time: i64) -> Result<i64> {
        Ok(event_time)
      }

  partition:
    assign-key:
      run: |
        fn assign_word_key(word: String) -> Result<String> {
          Ok(word.to_lowercase().chars().filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric()).collect())
        }

    update-state:
      run: |
        fn increment_word_count(word: String) -> Result<()> {
          count_per_word().increment(1);
          Ok(())
        }

  flush:
    run: |
      fn compute_most_used_words() -> Result<TopWords> {
          let word_counts = count_per_word();
          let top3 = word_counts.sql("select * from count_per_word order by count desc limit 3")?;
          let rows = top3.rows()?;
          let columns = top3.schema(["_key","count"])?;
          let mut top_words = vec![];
          match &columns[..] {
            [key,value] => {
                while rows.next() {
                  let word = rows.str(&key)?;
                  let count = rows.u32(&value)?;
                  let word_count = WordCount { word, count };
                  top_words.push(word_count);
                }
              },
                _ => return Err(anyhow::anyhow!("unexpected schema")),
            }
            Ok(top_words)
      }
```

First section is the window properties, followed by partitioning, and finally the flush.
