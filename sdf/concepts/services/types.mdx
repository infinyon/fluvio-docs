The types define the schema of the object used in the dataflow.   Once defined, the types can be used in the state, operators, source and sinks.  Using built-in serializer, the dataflow can be serialize and deserialize from/to the topic.

Types are in defined `types` section of the dataflow.  They can be defined in the package which can be shared across multiple dataflows.

## Primitive Types

The primitive types represents basic primitive types.  The following are the list of primitive types:

- `bool`  boolean value
- `u8`,`u16`,`u32`,`u64`  unsigned integers of 8, 16, 32, 64 bits
- `i8`,`i16`,`i32`,`i64`  signed integers of 8, 16, 32, 64 bits
- `f32`,`f64`  floating point numbers of 32, 64 bits

Primitive types can be alias or used as part of the complex types.  Following is type alias for `u16` and `f64`.  So instead of using `u16` and `f64`, you can use `range` and `latitude` respectively.

```yaml
types:
  range:
    type: u16
  latitude:
    type: f64
  weight:
    type: f8
```

## String

String is a sequence of characters.  It is defined as `string` type.

<hr />

## Object

Object type represents a complex type that has multiple properties.  It is defined as `object` type.  The properties are defined as key-value pairs.
For example, the following is a simple object type representing a person.

```yaml

types:
  person:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
      weight:
        type: u8
```

The property type can be any primitive type or complex type.  So using `alias` defined above, you can define `person` as follows:

```yaml
types:
  person:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
      weight:
        type: weight
```

<hr />


## Enum

Can represents different variant of the type.  It can represent a simple enum or sum type.  To define enum, use `enum` followed by `oneOf` properties.

For example, the following is a simple enum type representing fruits.

```yaml
types:
  fruit:
    type: enum
    oneOf:
      apple:
        type: null
      banana:
        type: null
      grape:
        type: null
```

This can represent enum value such as `apple`, `banana`, `grape` depends on serialization scheme.  By default, enum variant doesn't need have value type.  Value type is useful if variant has associated value.

For example, the following is a enum type representing vehicle type with associated value.

```yaml
types:
  vehicle:
    type: enum
    oneOf:
      car:
        type: car
      airplane:
        type: airplane
  car:
    type: object
    properties:
      model:
        type: string
      range:
        type: u16
  airplane:
    type: object
    properties:
      model:
        type: string
      engines:
        type: u8
      celing:
        type: u32
```
If this is serialized as JSON, it will look like this:

```json
{
  "vehicle": {
    "car": {
      "model": "tesla",
      "range": 300
    }
  },
  "vehicle": {
    "airplane": {
      "model": "737",
      "engines": 2,
      "celing": 35000
    }
  }
}
```

<hr />


## List 

List represents an ordered sequence of items.  It is defined as `list` type.  The item must be same type.  For example, the following is a list type representing list of fruits.

```yaml
types:
  fruits:
    type: list
    items:
      type: fruit
```

If this is serialized as JSON, it will look like this:

```json
{
  "fruits": ["apple","banana","grape"]
}
```

<hr />

## Key-Value

Key-Value type is used by partitioned state.  `Key-Value` can be defined in the `type` section or as part of the `state` definition.  The following is a key-value type representing a word count in the state.

```yaml
states:
  count-per-word:
    type: keyed-state
    properties:
      key:
        type: string
      value:
        type: u16
```

or it can be defined in the `type` section as follows:

```yaml
types:
  word-count:
    type: keyed-state
    properties:
      key:
        type: string
      value:
        type: u16
```

<hr />


## Types in the Operator 

Once the types are defined, it can be used in the operator.  For example, the following is a `map` operator that takes `Car` type and return `CarLocation` type.

```yaml
transforms:
  - operator: map
    run: |
      fn get_car_location(car: Car) -> Result<CarLocation> {
        Ok(CarLocation {
          car: format!("{} {}", car.maker, car.model),
          color: car.color,
          location: car.location,
        })
      }
```

Note that when used in the operator, type name will be translated according to languages convention.  For example, in Rust, the type name will be `CarLocation` because Rust uses CamelCase.  In Python, it will be `car_location` because Python uses snake_case.

## Types in the Source and Sink for Serialization and Deserialization

Types are used in the source and sink for serialization and deserialization.  It is configured globally in the dataflow as default for all topics.  It can be also configured per source or sink..

For example, following set JSON as default serialization for all topics.

```yaml
config:
  converter: json
  consumer:
    default_starting_offset:
      value: 0
      position: End
```
