# Dataflow File: dataflow.yaml

The `dataflow.yaml` file defines the end-to-end composition [DAG] of the data-streaming application. The dataflows can perform a variety of operations, such as:

* **routing** with service chaining, split and merge
* **shaping** with transforms operators
* **state processing** with state operators
* **window aggregates** with window operators

and cover a board set of use cases.

The dataflow user-defined business logic can be applied `inline` or `imported` from packages. This document focuses on `inline` dataflows. The [composition section] defines dataflows imported from packages.


## Service Composition

Services are core building blocks of a dataflow, where each service represents a flow that has one or more sources, one or more operators, and one or more destinations. Operators are processed in the order they are defined in the service definition. Each operator has an independent state machine.

Services that read from unrelated topics are processed in parallel, whereas services that read from a topic written by another service are processed in sequence.

  style={{ display: 'block', margin:'0 auto' }} width="800" />

In this example, Service-X and Service-Y form a parallel chain, whereas Service-Y and Service-Z form a sequential chain.

The [Services Section] defines the different types of services the engine supports.


## File: `dataflow.yaml`

The dataflow file is defined in YAML and has the following hierarchy:

```bash
apiVersion: <version>

meta: 
  <metadata-properties>
imports: 
  <import-properties>
config: 
  <config-properties>
types: 
  <types-properties>
topics: 
  <topics-properties>
services: 
  <service-properties>
dev: 
  <development-properties>
```

#### Where

* [apiVersion](#apiversion) - defines engine version of the dataflow file.
* [meta](#meta) - defines the name, version, and namespace of the dataflow.
* [imports](#imports) - defines the external packages `optional`.
* [config](#config) - defines configutions applied to the entire dataflow file `optional`.
* [types](#types)- definess the type definitions `optional`.
* [topics](#topics) - defines the topics used in the datataflow.
* [services](#services) - defines the input, output, operators and states for each flow.
* [dev](#dev) - defines properties for developers `optional`.

Let's go over each section in detail.

<hr/>

### `apiVersion`

The `apiVersion` informs the engine about the runtime version it must use to execute a particular dataflow.

```yaml
apiVersion: <version>
```

#### Where
  - **apiVersion** - is the version number of the dataflow engine to use.


#### For example

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{ApiVersion}</CodeBlock>

<hr/>


### `meta`

Meta, short for metadata, holds the stateful dataflow properties, such as name & version.

```yaml
meta:
  name: <dataflow-name>
  version: <dataflow-version>
  namespace: <dataflow-namespace>
```

#### Where

* **name** - is the name of the dataflow.
* **version** - the version number of the dataflow (semver).
* **namespace** - the namespace this dataflow belongs to.

The tuple `namespace:name` becomes the [WASM Component Model] package name.

#### For example

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{Metadata}</CodeBlock>

<hr/>

### `imports`

The `imports` section is used to import external packages into a dataflow. A package may define one or more types, functions, and states. A dataflow can import from as many packages as needed.

```yaml
imports:
  - pkg: <package-namespace>/<package-name>@<package-version>
    types:
      - name: <type-name>
    functions:
      - name: <function-name>
    states:
      - name: <state-name>
```

#### Where

* **pkg** - is the unique identifired of the package
* **types** - the list of types referenced by name.
* **functions** - the list of functions referenced by name.
* **states** - the list of states referenced by name.

#### For example

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{Imports}</CodeBlock>

<hr/>


### `config`

Config, short for configurations, defines the configuration parameters applied to the entire dataflow.

```yaml
config:
  converter: 
    <converter-properties>
  consumer: 
    <consumer-properties>
  producer: 
    <procucer-properties>
```

#### Where

* **converter** - define the default serializaiton/deserialization for reading and writing events. Supported formats are: `raw` and `json`. The converter configuration can be overwritten by the topic configuration.

* **consumer** - define the default consumer configuration. Supported properties are:
  * `default_starting_offset` - define the default starting offset for the consumer. The consumer can read from `beginning` or `end` with an offset `value`. User `0` if you want to read the first or last item.

* **producer** - define the default producer configuration. Supported properties are:
  * `linger_ms` - the time in milliseconds to wait for additional records to arrive before publishing a message batch.
  * `batshe_size` - the maximum size of a message batch.

Checkout [batching] for more details.


#### For example

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{Config}</CodeBlock>

All consumers start reading from the end of the datastream and parse the records from json. All producers write their records to the datastream in json.


#### Defaults

The `config` field is optional, and by default the system will read records from the `end` and decode records as `raw`.

<hr/>


### `topics`

Dataflows use topics for internal and external communications. During the Dataflow initialization, the engine creates new topics or links to existing ones before it starts the services.

The topics have a definition section that defines their schema and a provisioning section inside the [service](#services).

The topic definition can have one or more topics:

```yaml
topics:
  <topic-name>:
    schema:
      key:
        type: <type-name>
        converter: 
          <converter-type>
      value:
        type: <type-name>
        converter: 
          <converter-type>
    consumer: 
      <consumer-properties>
    producer: 
      <producer-properties>
```

#### Where

* **topic-name** - is the name of the topic.
* **key** - is the schema definition for the record key (**optional**).
  * **type** - is the schema type for the key.
  * **converter** - is the converter to deserialize the key (**optional** - defaults to [config](#config)).
* **value** - is the schema definition for the record value
  * **type** - is the schema type for the value.
  * **converter** - is the converter to deserialize the key (**optional** - ddefaults to [config](#config)).
* **producer** - is the producer configuration (**optional** - defaults to [config](#config)).
* **consumer** - is the consumer configuration (**optional** - defaults to [config](#config)).

#### For Example

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{Topics}</CodeBlock>

The [Services key-value section] describes how to map topic keps to functions.

<hr/>


### `types`

Dataflows use types to define the schema of the objects in topics, states, and functions. 
* Check out the [Types] section for the list of supported types.


<hr/>

### `services`

Services define the dataflow composition and the business logic. Check out the [Services] section for details.

<hr/>


### `dev`

The [sdf] command line tool offers commands to run a dataflow file.
