Dataflows and packages can import function and types from other packages.  This hierarchical import structure allows you to reuse code and types across multiple projects.

Importing a package involves these steps:
- specifying the package to import
- specifying the functions
- specifying the types to import

You can either import functions or types or both.

# Importing Functions

Use keyword: `functions` in a `imports` sections to import functions.

Syntax: 
```yaml
imports:
  - pkg: <package-namespace>/<package-name>@<package-version>
    functions:
      - name: <function-name>
        alias: <alias-name>
```    


Here is sample config to  imports a function `my-hello-fn` from the package `sdf-test/hello`:

```yaml
imports:
  - pkg: sdf-test/hello@0.2.0
    functions:
      - name: my-hello-fn
        alias: hello-fn
```

The function can be alias to a different name. In this case, the function `my-hello-fn` is imported as `hello-fn`.

After import, you can reference the function with the `uses` keyword. 

```yaml
  transforms:
      - operator: filter-map
        uses: hello-fn
```

Since `hello-fn` is filter-map function, It can only be used in the `filter-map` operator.

# Importing Types

Similar to functions, you can also import types from other packages.

Syntax: 
```yaml
imports:
  - pkg: <package-namespace>/<package-name>@<package-version>
    types:
      - name: <type-name>
```

Here is sample config that imports a type `my-hello-type` from the package `sdf-test/hello`:

```yaml
imports:
  - pkg: sdf-test/hello@0.2.0
    types:
      - name: my-hello-type
```

Of course you can mix and match functions and types in the same `imports` section.

```yaml
imports:
  - pkg: sdf-test/hello@0.2.0
    functions:
      - name: my-hello-fn
    types:
      - name: my-hello-type
```

# Recursive Imports

Recursive imports are also supported.  You can import functions and types from packages that themselves import functions and types from other packages.
