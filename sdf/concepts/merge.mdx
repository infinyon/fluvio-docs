Dataflows can merge events from multiple topics. The merge behavior is defined in the `sources` section of the service definition. The record type of all sources must match, otherwise use the `map` operator to transform as required.

```yaml
  sources:
    - type: topic
      id: <topic-id>
      transforms:
        - operator: <operator-name>
          ...
    - type: topic
      id: <topic-id>
      transforms:
        - operator: <operator-name>
```

The `transforms` section defines the transformation to apply to the event before sending it to the service. The operator type depends on the desired business logic.

## Merge Example

We'll create a dataflow that reads records from the `child` and `adult` topics and merges into the `people` topic.


#### 1. Create a Dataflow file

Create a directory `merge-test`:

```bash
$ mkdir merge-test; cd merge-test
```

Add the following `dataflow.yaml` file:

```yaml
# dataflow.yaml
apiVersion: 0.4.0

meta:
  name: merge
  version: 0.1.0
  namespace: examples

config:
  converter: json

types:
  person:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
      age:
        type: i32

topics:
  child:
    schema:
      value:
        type: person
  adult:
    schema:
      value:
        type: person
  people:
    schema:
      value:
        type: person

services:
  merge-service:
    sources:
      - type: topic
        id: child
      - type: topic
        id: adult
    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: people
```

In this example, we don't use any operators as the target schema matches the source. If there is a mismatch, use `map` and update the record accordingly.

```bash
$ sdf run
```

Add `--ui` if you want to see the graphical representation of the dataflow.


#### 2. Test the Dataflow

Produce to `adult`:

```bash
$ fluvio produce adult
```

```bash
{"name":"Randy","age":32}
{"name":"Alice","age":28}
```

Produce to `child`:

```bash
$ fluvio produce child
```

```bash
{"age":16,"name":"Andrew"}
{"age":17,"name":"Jackson"}
{"age":15,"name":"Linda"}
```

Consume from `people`:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume people -Bd
```

```bash
{"age":32,"name":"Randy"}
{"age":28,"name":"Alice"}
{"age":16,"name":"Andrew"}
{"age":17,"name":"Jackson"}
{"age":15,"name":"Linda"}
```

In summary, `merge-service` utilizes `sources` to merge the data from different topics: `child` and `adult` into a single topic `people`.
