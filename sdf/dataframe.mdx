States are one of the core concepts in stateful dataflows.  States can be partitioned by key which is used to divided state into multiple partitions.  

Each partition state can have many different types.  One of the type is `arrow-row`.  For example, follow snippe define state `count_per_word` that store each row into arrow dataframe.

```yaml
    states:
      count-per-word:
        type: keyed-state
        properties:
          key:
            type: string
          value:
            type: arrow-row
            properties:
              count: 
                type: u32
```


In here, we are defining a state `count_per_word` to track frequency of the words.  For each key, we have a row that has a column `count` that store the count of the word.
For example, let's we have following word: `apple`, `orange`, `banana`, `orange`, `grape`, `orange`, `banana`.  

Then this will be mapped to arrow dataframe as follows:

| _key | count |
| --- | --- |
| apple | 2 |
| orange | 3 |
| banana | 2 |
| grape | 1 |


To update the state, you can use the `update-state` operator as below:

```yaml 
update-state:
    run: |
    fn count_word(_word: String) -> Result<()> {
        let mut state = count_per_word();
        state.count += 1;
        state.update()?;
        Ok(())
    }
```

Note that state value can be access using `count_per_word` state function which is automatically injected by SDF builder.

Most operator like `update-state`, operator, state function only return value of the partition state. 

In the example, `count_per_word` represents a row value of the dataframe.  If operator sees  `apple`, it will be first row in the dataframe above.

However aggregate operator like: `flush` can access entire state and perform aggregation across all partitions.  In that case, state function `count_per_word` return entire dataframe not just rows.
In that case, you can use perform dataframe operation using SQL api.  Below is snippet that use sql to get 3 most frequent words. 

```yaml
flush:
    run: |
        fn aggregate_wordcount() -> Result<TopWords> {
        let word_counts = count_per_word();

        let top3 = word_counts.sql("select * from count_per_word order by count desc limit 3")?;
        let rows = top3.rows()?;

        let mut top_words = vec![];
        let key = top3.key()?;
        let count = top3.col("count")?;

        while rows.next() {
            let word = rows.str(&key)?;
            let count = rows.u32(&count)?;
            let word_count = WordCount { word, count };
            top_words.push(word_count);
        }



        Ok(top_words)
        }
```

# SQL API

For any state that is dataframe, you can use SQL API to perform dataframe operation.  SDF uses polar SQL to perform dataframe operation.  
The result of the SQL operation is always dataframe.  So you can perform multiple SQL operation to get the desired result.

The SQL is executed in the context of the dataframe.  And name of the dataframe is state as illustrated below:

```rust
let top3 = word_counts.sql("select * from count_per_word order by count desc limit 3")?;
```

# Row API

Once you have dataframe, you can use row api to access values of individual rows.  To get rows, you can use `rows` function on the dataframe.

```rust
let rows = top3.rows()?;
```

You can think of row as iterator that you can use to access individual row.  Following functions are available on row object.
To access row values, must first get columns like below:

```rust
let count = top3.col("count")?;
```

To get key, can use helper function `key`:

```rust
let key = top.key()?;
```

Use `next` function to goto next row.  If successful, it will return true.  If there are no more rows, it will return false.

```rust
while rows.next() {
    ...
}
```

As long as `next` is true, you can access current value by passing column.  Each column has type associated with it.  So you can only acess values that are compatible with the column type otherwise it will return error.

For example, to get string value, you can use `str` function. To get u32 value, you can use `u32` function.

```rust
let word = rows.str(&key)?;
let count = rows.u32(&count)?;
```
