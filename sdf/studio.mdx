# Studio

SDF Studio is the official web-based user interface for visualizing SDF dataflows. Infinyon Cloud users can find the application on the [Infinyon Cloud website]. Additionally, self-hosted SDF users can deploy the SDF Studio webserver locally via the SDF CLI.

### Running SDF Studio in a self-hosted environment

### Without a worker:

```bash
$> sdf run --ui
```

### When deploying to a worker:

```bash
$> sdf deploy --ui
```
