# Studio

SDF Studio is the official user interface for Stateful Dataflows. Studio can be used to visualize dataflow graphs and view relevant metrics.

## Using SDF Studio in Infinyon Cloud

Infinyon Cloud users can find the application on the [Infinyon Cloud website].

## Running SDF Studio in a self-hosted environment

Self-hosted SDF users can deploy the SDF Studio webserver locally via the SDF CLI.

### When running a dataflow without a worker:

```bash
$> sdf run --ui
```

### When deploying to a worker:

```bash
$> sdf deploy --ui
```
