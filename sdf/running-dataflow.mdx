To run a dataflow, you need to have worker selected unless you are using `-ephemeral` flag which will run the dataflow in the same process as the CLI.  

Assuming you are using a worker, you can run the dataflow using the following command:

```bash
$ sdf run
```

This command will upload dataflow 
```bash
