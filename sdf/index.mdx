Stateful Dataflows is the embodiment of versatility in data pipelines. A utility that helps developers build, troubleshoot, and run full-featured event-driven pipelines (dataflows), SDF sparks innovation among data engineers. By leveraging [fluvio], SDF seemlessly integrates event streaming with stateful processing. Built in Rust and powered by WebAssembly, SDF dataflows are small, fast, and incredibly versatile. They empower engineers to write custom logic snippets that compile to WebAssembly and inject them into the dataflow for in-line processing. This custom logic can perform various tasks, from data transformations and error correction to malicious payload detection and complex stateful processing.

The following example is a dataflow that performs various operations on data from traffic sensors at different locations.

#### Stateful Dataflows vs. Big Data Stream Processing

Unlike traditional big data frameworks built in Java, like Kafka, Flink, KStream, and Spark, where each component is independently managed, scaled, and built into dataflows through external microservices, InfinyOn Stateful Dataflows introduces a unique paradigm. This paradigm empowers users to quickly develop and test individual services in their favorite programming language. It seamlessly integrates them into scalable end-to-end dataflows, streamlining the entire data processing workflow.


#### Stateful Dataflows vs. Legacy Solutions

Automating data operations within legacy technology stacks, spanning message brokers, databases, microservices, and batch jobs, typically demands months of setup and years of experimentation before yielding positive outcomes. InfinyOn Stateful Dataflows frees you from infrastructure intricacies and lets you focus on your core business logic instead.


#### Who is this for?

This platform is tailored for developers creating event-driven applications with continuous enrichment. The product streamlines the composition of dataflows with external sources such as databases, AI/ML models, and Redis caches, producing powerful results for analytics, applications, and operational dashboards.


#### How are Stateful Dataflows different from Fluvio?

Stateful Dataflows are an extension of Fluvio, leveraging the Fluvio infrastructure for communication and persistence. Fluvio is responsible for connectors, data streaming, and persistence, whereas dataflows handle data routing, transformations, and stateful processing.


#### How do I integrate this into my existing data architecture?

Fluvio [connectors] serve as the interface to external ingress and egress services. Fluvio publishes a growing library of connectors, such as HTTP, Kafka, NATs, SQL, S3, etc. Connectors are easy to build, test, deploy, and share with the community.

#### How do I get started?

Provisioning and operating a Stateful Dataflow requires the following system components:

1. [Fluvio Cluster] to enable dataflows to consume and produce streaming data.

2. [Dataflow File] to define the schema, composition, services, and operations.

3. [SDF (Stateful Dataflows) CLI] to build, test, and deploy the dataflows.

The Stateful Dataflows can be built, tested, and run locally during preview releases. As we approach general availability, they can also be deployed in your InfinyOn Cloud cluster. In addition, the dataflows may be published to [Hub] and shared with others with one click and installation.
