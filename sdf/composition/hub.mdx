# Introduction

The InfinyOn Hub is the cloud infrastructure for sharing and discovering SDF packages.  Please see [Hub] for more information.

An SDF Package can be published as either a public or private package.  Public packages are available to anyone without restriction.  Private packages are only available to users who have been granted access to the namespace.

By default, all packages are private unless explicitly published as public.



# Ready for Publishing

SDF Packages are immutable.  Once published, the package cannot be changed.  If you need to make changes, you will need to create a new version of the package.  This is why it is important to ensure that the package is tested and ready for publishing.

SDF packages follow semver versioning.  The version number is specified in the `meta.version` field of the package file.

Before publishing,
- Test with `sdf test` to ensure it is working with sample data.
- Run with test dataflow to ensure it is working in a dataflow.

To test with a dataflow, create a dataflow file and add `dev` section at the bottom of the file:
```
dev:
  imports:
    - pkg: example/sentence-pkg@0.1.0
      path: ./packages/sentence
```

The dev section instructs the dataflow to use the package from the local directory.

Then run the dataflow with with ephemeral mode: `sdf run --ephemeral` otherwise dataflow will not be able to find the package.

# Publishing

After tested and ready, publish the package using with `sdf publish` command.  As mentioned before, the packages are private by default.

```bash
$ sdf publish
```

To list all the packages run: `sdf hub list` command.

```bash
$ sdf hub list
```

## Publishing as package as public, use `--public` flag

```bash
$ sdf publish --public
```

Once you have published the package, it will be available to anyone.  Each version of package can be published as public or private.

# Using Hub Package from Dataflow or Package

Please see [Imports] for more information on how to use packages from the Hub in the dataflow or package files.

When you run the dataflow or package, imported packages will be automatically downloaded from the Hub and used.
