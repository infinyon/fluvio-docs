# Getting Started with Stateful Dataflows

This guide will get you started with [SDF], an utility that helps developers build, troubleshoot, and run full-featured event-driven dataflows.


#### Example Dataflow

As an example, we'll create a dataflow that splits sentences into words, and counts the number of characters in each word.

<img src="/img/sdf/_release-app.jpg" alt="Preview Example"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto', border: 'solid #ddd' }} width="700" />

The dataflow reads from `sentences` topic and writes to `words` topics.  This example is available for download in [github].


## Prerequisites

Building a Stateful Dataflow requires the following software:

* Rust **1.80** or beyond - [Install Rust]
* `wasm32-wasip1` Rust target installed. Typically, installed with: `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1`


## Installing Fluvio & Start a Cluster

SDF requires a Fluvio Cluster to consume, produce, and stream records between services.

Download and install the CLI.

```bash copy="fl"
$ curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash
```

This command will download the Fluvio Version Manager (fvm), Fluvio CLI (fluvio) and config files into `$HOME/.fluvio`, with the executables in `$HOME/.fluvio/bin`. To complete the installation, you must add the executables to your shell `$PATH`.

Start a **Local** cluster:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cluster start
```

If you prefer to run your cluster in InfinyOn Cloud follow the instructions [here].

Run the following command to check the CLI and the Cluster platform versions:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio version
```

Your Fluvio cluster is ready for use.


## Install and Setup SDF

SDF is in beta and it requires the following image:

```bash
fvm install sdf-beta3
```

You can validate prerequisites with:

```bash
sdf setup
All pre-requisites are installed!
```

Your SDF environment is ready to go.


## Use `Composition` to build a Stateful Dataflow

Composition has two main components, [packages](#1-building-a-package) and [dataflows](#2-build-the-stateful-dataflow). You can build and test a package independently, then import it into a dataflow. For additional information, check out the [Composition] section.

### 1. Building a Package

The package is a collection of services, functions, and states that can be defined, tested, then be imported into a dataflow.

Let's build one:

#### 1.1 Create a Package File

Open the terminal, create a fresh project directory, say `split-sentence`, where we'll add the dataflow later on. Inside the project directory, create a `packages` directory and a subdirectory `sentence` for the package itself:

```bash
$ mkdir -p split-sentence/packages/sentence
$ cd split-sentence/packages/sentence
```

Inside the `sentence` directory and create an file called `sdf-package.yaml` and add the following content:

```yaml title="sdf-package.yaml"
apiVersion: 0.5.0

meta:
  name: sentence-pkg
  version: 0.1.0
  namespace: example

functions:

  sentence-to-words:
    operator: flat-map
    inputs:
      - name: sentence
        type: string
    output:
      type: string

  augment-count:
    operator: map
    inputs:
      - name: word
        type: string
    output:
      type: string

dev:
  converter: raw
```

The package file instructs the generator to build two functions, `sentence-to-words` and `augment-count`, that we intend to implement. In addition, it tells the `sdf test` runtime that our inputs should be ingested as `raw` for testing our routines.

#### 1.2 Generate the Package Project

The SDF generate command parses the `sdf-package.yaml` file and builds the project:

```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf generate
```

The generator created several directories and files that we'll edit next.


#### 1.3 Add the Custom Code

First let's update the first function `sentence-to-words`. Open `rust/sentence-pkg/src/sentence_to_words.rs` and update the function body with the following code:

```rust
fn sentence_to_words(sentence: String) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
    Ok(sentence.split_whitespace().map(String::from).collect())
}
```

Next update `augment_count`. Open `rust/sentence-pkg/src/augment_count.rs` and replace the function body:

```rust
fn augment_count(word: String) -> Result<String> {
    Ok(format!("{}({})", word, word.chars().count()))
}
```

Let's add some tests as well:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_augment_count() {
        let input = "Hello".to_string();
        let output = Component::augment_count(input);
        assert_eq!(output.unwrap(), "Hello(5)");
    }
}
```

We've implemented both functions, it's time to compile and test our work.


#### 1.4 Build and Test the Package

To build the package, run:

```bash
$ sdf build
```

SDF has a built-in `test` interactive shell. Let's bring it up:

```bash
$ sdf test
```

In the test shell, you can view the functions available for testing:

```bash copy="fl"
>> show functions
sentence-to-words
augment-count
```

Let's test `sentence-to-words` first:

```bash copy="fl"
>> test function sentence-to-words --value "Hello World"
Hello
World
```

Next, test `augment-count`:

```bash
>> test function augment-count --value "Hello"
Hello(5)
```

You may also test the `rust` code via Cargo:

```bash
cd rust/augment-count
cargo test
```

The tests passed, and package now is ready to use in the dataflow file.


### 2. Build the Stateful Dataflow

We are building a dataflow that reads words from `sentences` topic, and publishes the result to `words` topic. Let's get started.


#### 2.1 Create a Dataflow File

Navigate to the base project directory.

```bash
$ cd ../../
```

Create a file called `dataflow.yaml` and copy/paste the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: 0.5.0

meta:
  name: split-sentence
  version: 0.1.0
  namespace: example

imports:
  - pkg: example/sentence-pkg@0.1.0
    path: ./packages/sentence
    functions:
      - name: sentence-to-words
      - name: augment-count

topics:
  sentence:
    schema:
      value:
        type: string
        converter: raw
  words:
    schema:
      value:
        type: string
        converter: raw

services:
  sentence-words:
    sources:
      - type: topic
        id: sentence

    transforms:
      - operator: flat-map
        uses: sentence-to-words
      - operator: map
        uses: augment-count

    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: words

dev:
  imports:
    - pkg: example/sentence-pkg@0.1.0
      path: ./packages/sentence
```

This example focuses on composition, and the area of interest is the `imports` section:

* `package` - is the name of the package we are importing (a composition of the `meta` fields of the package)
* `path` - is the relative directory where this package can be found.
* `functions` - the name of the functions we want to import.

The imported functions are then referenced them by name in the `transforms` section.


#### 2.2 Run the Dataflow

Let's run the project:

```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf run --ui
Please visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 to view your workflow visualization

>>
```

**Note:**
* The `run` command performs multiple operations:
  * imports and links all packages
  * compiles inline code (if needed)
  * looks-up the topics in the cluster and automatically creates them if they don't exist.
* The `--ui` flag generates a visual representation of the dataflow at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>.
* When you close the `run` interactive editor, the dataflow stops processing records.


#### 2.3 Test the Dataflow

To test the dataflow, we'll generate to one topic and read from the other.

Produce a sentence in the `sentence` topic:

```bash copy="fl"
$ echo 'Hello from stateful dataflows' | fluvio produce sentence
```

Consume from the `words` topic:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume words -Bd
Consuming records from 'words' starting from the beginning of log
Hello(5)
from(4)
stateful(8)
dataflows(9)
```

Note, the both functions have been applied, with the first function splitting the sentence into words and the second counting the number of characters in each word.

SDF also exposes execution metrics. To view the metrics, run:

```bash copy="fl"
>> show state
 Namespace                                 Keys  Type
 sentence-words/augment-count/metrics      1     table
 sentence-words/sentence/topic.offset      1     offset
 sentence-words/sentence-to-words/metrics  1     table
 sentence-words/sentence/metrics           1     table
```

Let's pick a metric:

```bash copy="fl"
>> show state  sentence-words/augment-count/metrics
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       4          0
```

:tada: Congratulations! You have successfully used composition to build a Stateful Dataflow.
