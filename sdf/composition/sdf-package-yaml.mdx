# Package File (`sdf-package.yaml`)

Packages enable you to organize your code into logical units and reuse them across dataflows. A package may define `functions,` `types,` and `states` built and tested independently and imported in [dataflows].

Package files do not have code, but rather API definitions that are used to generate code. The [sdf CLI generate] command uses the API definitions to generate the code. Afte running the code generator, use your favorite editor to build and test the package.

## `sdf-package.yaml` file

The package file is defined in YAML and has the following hierarchy:

```yaml title="sdf-package.yaml"
apiVersion: <version>

meta:
  name: <package-name>
  version: <package-version>
  namespace: <package-namespace>

imports:
  - pkg: <package-namespace>/<package-name>@<package-version>
    types:
      - name: <type-name>
    functions:
      - name: <function-name>
    states:
      - name: <state-name>

types:
  <type-name>: <type-props>

states:
  <state-name>: <state-props>

functions:
  <function-name>:
    operator: <operator-type>
    states:
      - name: <state-name>
    inputs:
      - name: <input-name>
        type: <input-type>
    output:
      type: <output-type>

dev:
  converter: <converter-props>
  imports:
    - pkg:  <package-namespace>/<package-name>@<package-version>
      path: <relative-path>

```

The sections are as follows:
* **apiVersion** - defines engine version of the package file.
* **meta** - defines the name, version, and namespace of the package.
* **imports** - imports other packages' types, states, functions (optional)
* **types** - definess the type definitions (optional).
* **states** - definess the state definitions (optional).
* **functions** - definess the function names, operators, states, the input and output parameters (optional).
* **dev** - defines the substitutions to be used during development and test (optional).


## Generate, Build and Test a Package

The [sdf] command line tool offers commands to [build] and [test] a package file.

Navigate to the directory with the `sdf-package.yaml` and perform the following commands:

1. Generate the build environment:

```bash
$ sdf generate
```

Add your code in the `rust` directory.


2. Build the package:

```bash
$ sdf build
```

3. Test the package

```bash
$ sdf test
```

After you've built and tested the packages, you can import the components in a dataflow file to create the data pipeline.
