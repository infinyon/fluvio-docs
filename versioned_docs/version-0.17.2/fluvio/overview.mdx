# Fluvio Overview

Fluvio is a lean distributed streaming engine designed for edge to core stream processing. It offers a unique combination of performance, scalability, and programmability, making it an ideal choice for building real-time data pipelines.
Written in Rust, Fluvio provides low-latency, secure, high-performance programmable streaming on cloud-native architecture.
Fluvio provides client libraries for Rust, Python, JavaScript and more. â€“ [Learn more about Fluvio client libraries]

## Cloud Native
Fluvio is cloud native by design. Built as a collection of loosely coupled components which run and scale dynamically on demand.
Fluvio is:
- Declarative - to reduce the management burden.
- Kubernetes native - to plug-in native in K8 environments.
- Horizontally scalable - to meet data elasticity requirements.
- Self-healing - to recover from failures without human intervention.

## Edge Native
Fluvio is built to be lean and efficient to cold start in milliseconds and operated efficiently on any system architecture.
Fluvio is:
- Lightweight - 37 MB single binary that runs on ARM64 IoT devices
- Event Driven - Fully event-driven with async architecture to support large I/O.
- Multithreaded - Leverage multi-core CPU architecture to operate at maximum performance.
- Fast - Internal component benchmarks are at nanosecond latency for data processing leading to a real-time system

## AI Native
Fluvio is built with full feature data processing APIs for analytics and AI. It's ideal for developers who want to build data pipelines to power intelligent applications.
Fluvio helps developers:
- Customize and manage Data Lifecycle.
- Orchestrate long-running data& AI pipelines.
- Deploy declarative APIs for stream processing and materialization.
