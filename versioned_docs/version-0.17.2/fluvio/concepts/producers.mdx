## Producer

Producers are applications that "produce" streaming data.
These applications may be monitoring the status of a system, collecting sensor
data, watching traffic to a website, or otherwise observing events in some way.
Producers may be general-purpose tools such as [the Fluvio CLI], or they may be
special-purpose programs built to meet a specific need, in which case the
producer program would leverage [one of the programmatic APIs].

Producer performance in transmitting data can be optimized by adjusting
batching parameters. See the [Batching page] for more details.
