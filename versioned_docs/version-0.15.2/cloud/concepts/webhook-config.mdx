## Webhook config template
```yaml
# example-webhook-template.yaml
meta:
  name: my-webhook
  topic: my-topic
# optional
transforms:
 - uses: smartmodule_name
   with:
     param_name: param_value
# optional
webhook:
  outputParts: [body | full (default)]
  outputType: [text | json (default)]
  outputUri: [none | full (default)]
```

## Config options
### Meta
* `name` - The name of your webhook
* `topic` - The name of the topic you want events to be stored. It will be automatically created if it doesn't exist.

### Transforms
Webhook connectors support `transforms`.  Records can be modified before they are sent to the topic. The transforms section is a list of transform objects. Each transform object has an uses and a with section.

* `uses` is the reference to the SmartModule used in the transform.
  *  `with` is the configuration for the transform
      *  The section is different for each transform
      *  See the connectors reference documentation for available configuration options

## Webhook
The output record from the webhook request is configurable

`outputParts` options:
* `full` - Return the headers and body of the request (Default)
* `body` - Only return the body of the request

`outputType` options:
* `json`- Output is parsed into json
* `text` - Output is plaintext (Default)

`outputUri` options:
* `full` - Parse URI path and query parameters into output
* `none` - Don't parse path and query parameters into output (Default)
* `path` - Only record path into the output
* `query` - Only record query parameters into the output

## output behavior

If `outputUri` behavior is fully enabled, information from the URI call is encoded in
the webhook records.

A http webhook connection to a URI of `https://infinyon.cloud/webhooks/v1/[uri-key]/path1/path2/path3?p1=1&param2=2`
will return path and query information as follows:
* path: `path1/path2/path3`
* query: `p1=1&param2=2`

:::note

If intending to process URI `path` & `query` information with Smartmodule
transformations, it is recommended to also configure `outputType` to json.
The path and query parameters will be part of the json object and can be
directly operated upon by the Smartmodule.

See the How to Use WebHooks: [URI path & query] section for an example of
the json object.
