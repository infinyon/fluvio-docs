This page describes how to generally use any of the Fluvio clients.  Each
client has some differences but these are the general rules about them.

For more details on each available client, see the following:

## Connect to Fluvio

The first thing you want to do to use a Fluvio client is connect to the Fluvio
cluster.

## Producer

Once you've got a connection handler, you will want to create a producer for a
given topic.

The producer could be created with the following configurations: `max_request_size`, `batch_size`, `compression`, `linger` and `partitioner`.

These configurations control the behavior of the producer in the following way:

* `max_request_size`: Maximum number of bytes that the producer can send in a single request. If the record is larger than the max request size, the producer drops the record and returns an error. Defaults to 1048576 bytes.
* `batch_size`: Maximum number of bytes accumulated by the records before sending the batch. If the record is larger than the batch size, the producer will split the records and send them in multiple batches. Defaults to 16384 bytes.
* `compression`: Compression algorithm used by the producer to compress each batch before sending to the SPU. Supported compression algorithms are `none`, `gzip`, `snappy` and `lz4`.
* `linger`: The maximum time to wait to accumulate records before sending the batch. Defaults to 100 ms.
* `partitioner`: custom class/struct that assigns the partition to each record that needs to be send. Defaults to Siphash Round Robin partitioner.

### Sending

When sending into a stream, the general `send` will take a `key` and a `value`.
The `key` is optional. For clients which don't have `Option` as a feature, this
is simply an empty array.

Depending on the client, these can be `string` or an array of `bytes`.

Depending on the producer configuration, a `send` call will not send immediately the record to the SPU. `flush` is used to immediately send all the queued records in the producer batches. Producers should `flush` before terminating to ensure that all records are sent properly.

## Consumer

Similar to a [producing](#producer), once you've got a connection, you'll need
to create a consumer for a given topic.

### Streams

Once you've got a consumer, you can create a stream given an [offset](#offsets)
and listen for new items.

Most of our clients support idiomatic ways of iterating over the items in the stream:
* The rust client stream uses a [`Stream`]
* The node client stream implements the [`asyncIterator`]
* The python client stream implements `__next__` making it a [Python Iterator]

[`Stream`]: https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.15/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html
[`asyncIterator`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of
[Python Iterator]: https://wiki.python.org/moin/Iterator

This functionality has not been implemented for the java client yet.

### Offsets

An offset is used when a stream is created to request the stream to start at
`N` items from the beginning/end of the stream.

### Records

Each item in a [stream](#streams) is a `Record`.

Our clients differ a little bit on this but a `Record` is a wrapper around
array of bytes with accessor methods of `key` or `value`.

In the python, node and java clients, we have to-string convenience methods.

### Timestamps

Fluvio `Records` contain timestamp information. As of Fluvio `0.9.25`, the timestamp of each record is set by Fluvio Producer on creation, previously the timestamp fields were uninitialized. This information is available to the consumer using the respective API call `timestamp()`.
