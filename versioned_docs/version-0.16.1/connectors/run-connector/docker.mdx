# Run Connectors on Docker

This document will guide you through downloading an running a fluvio connector on Docker. The files below are also [in github].

# Prerequisites

The Docker container requires a Fluvio profile and a connector configuration file. The profile passes the credentials to the connector. The configuration file specifies the connector properties.


## 1. Create a Dockerfile

Open and editor and create a new file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{Dockerfile}</CodeBlock>

The Dockerfile performs the following operations:
* installs the Fluvio CLI
* copies the profile to the container
* downloads `http-source` connector from InfinyOn Hub. 
* runs the connector

To run a different connector, perform the following steps:
* run `fluvio hub connector list` to list the available connectors
* change `infinyon/http-source@0.3.8` and `infinyon-http-source-0.3.8.ipkg` with your connector equivalent.
* change the executable command `http-source` to connector equivalent.


## 2. Export Fluvio profile

The connector requires a Fluvio profile to authenticate with the cluster. If you use multiple profiles it is important to choose the profile for your target cluster before you export. 

List the available profiles:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio profile list
```

Export the active profile to a file named `fluvio_profile.toml`.

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio profile export > fluvio_profile.toml
```

:::tip
If you don't have a fluvio profile, [install fluvio] and create a cluster. The profile will be created automatically.
::: 


## 2. Create a Connector Configuration File

The following configuration file allows you to run the`http-source` connector to read a new quote `quote` from the `demo-data` server every 2 seconds. Copy the following configuration to a file named `connector.yaml`:

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{ConnectorYaml}</CodeBlock>

If you run a differenet connector, change the configuration to match the connector.


## 3. Build  & Run the Docker Image

Build your Docker image using the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash" copyBehavior="fl">{DockerBuild}</CodeBlock>

Where `my-org` is your organization/domain name.

Run the image:

<CodeBlock language="bash" copyBehavior="fl">{DockerRun}</CodeBlock>


## 4. Check the Result

The connector will start producing quotes to the `quotes` topic.

Open a new terminal and run the following command to view the messages:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume quotes
```

A new quote is generated every 2 seconds.
