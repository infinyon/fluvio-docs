### Generate a Connector

CDK generate helps developers build a sample Connector project by answering a few simple questions.

Use `cdk generate` to create a new connector project:

```shell
$ cdk generate
ðŸ¤·   Project Name: my-connector
ðŸ¤·   Please set a group name: acme
ðŸ¤·   Which type of Connector would you like [source/sink]? Â· source
ðŸ¤·   Will your Connector be public? Â· false
[1/8]   Done: .gitignore
[2/8]   Done: Cargo.toml
[3/8]   Done: Connector.toml
[4/8]   Done: README.md
[5/8]   Done: sample-config.yaml
[6/8]   Done: src/config.rs
[7/8]   Done: src/main.rs
[8/8]   Done: src
```

The generator created Rust project ready to compile:

```
$ tree
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ Connector.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ sample-config.yaml
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ config.rs
    â””â”€â”€ main.rs
```

This a simple connector with the code in `src/main.rs`:

```rust title="src/main.rs"
mod config;
use config::CustomConfig;

use fluvio::{RecordKey, TopicProducerPool};
use fluvio_connector_common::{
    connector,
    Result
};

#[connector(source)]
async fn start(config: CustomConfig, producer: TopicProducerPool) -> Result<()> {
    println!("Starting my-connector source connector with {config:?}");
    for i in 1..1000 {
        let value = format!("Hello, Fluvio - {i}");
        producer.send(RecordKey::NULL, value).await?;
        producer.flush().await?;
        std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(1000));
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Connectors may also have define configuration parameters as shown in `src/config.rs`:

```rust title="src/config.rs"
use fluvio_connector_common::connector;

#[connector(config)]
#[derive(Debug)]
pub(crate) struct CustomConfig {
    #[allow(dead_code)]
    foo: String,
}
```

The `Connector.toml` file contains the definition of the Connector parameters required to load the file in the Cluster and publish it to Connector Hub.

```toml title="Connector.toml"
[package]
name = "my-connector"
group = "acme"
version = "0.1.0"
apiVersion = "0.1.0"
fluvio = "0.10.0"
description = ""
license = "Apache-2.0"
visibility = "private"

[direction]
source = true

[deployment]
binary = "my-connector"

[custom.properties.foo]
title = "Foo"
description = "Foo"
type = "string"
```

#### Sections

* `package` is used to build the connector FQDN `acme/my-connector@0.1.0`, and the description to publish to  Hub. The `group` name is equivalent to the package owner in the Hub.
* `direction` is used to declare the direction data flows through the connector, with respect to the Fluvio cluster. An inbound connector uses `source = true`, and and outbound connector uses `sink = true`
* `custom.properties.foo` defines a user configuration key `foo` that can be used in the logic of the connector.

The project is ready to build and test.
