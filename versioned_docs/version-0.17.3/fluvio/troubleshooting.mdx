This document will help you troubleshoot common issues with your Fluvio cluster.

## Troubleshooting a Local Cluster

To troubleshoot a local Fluvio cluster, you can check the logs of the SC and SPUs processes.

- Run `cat ~/.fluvio/log/flv_sc.log` for SC logs
- Run `cat ~/.fluvio/log/spu_log_XXXX.log` for each SPU
  - E.g. when running 1 SPU, there will be `spu_log_5001.log`

You can also use `tail -n 100 ~/.fluvio/log/flv_sc.log` to just print the last 100 lines of the log file.

### Getting help

You can ask for help from the Fluvio [Discord] group,

The logging information needed for diagnostics can be packaged up with the command
`fluvio cluster diagnostics`. The compressed archive can be shared in the Discord group or sent via PM to Infinyon admins

## Upgrading the Cluster

If you receive an error `Check Versions match failed Check Versions match failed: cannot resume a x.y.z cluster with fluvio version a.b.c.` This is an error that may be shown when upgrading Fluvio version of a locally deployed cluster. The fluvio cluster may need to be
upgraded to the new version: see the [`fluvio cluster upgrade`] command for more information.

### Log directory

By default, Fluvio logs are stored in the `~/.fluvio/log` directory.
But if you have the `FLUVIO_DIR` environment variable set, the logs will be stored in the directory specified by the variable.

### Setting log level

You can set various log levels as [filtering tracing log].

For example, to start cluster using log level `info` using cluster start

```bash
$ fluvio cluster start --rust-log=info
```

For individual binaries, you can use `RUST_LOG` env variable:

```bash
$ RUST_LOG=info fluvio run sc --local
```

The log level can be set to `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.

##  SPU Server Port Conflict
By default, the SPU server uses port 9010. If this port is already in use, the server will fail to start and report the following error:

```bash
Error binding TcpListener: Address already in use
```
To verify the issue, check the SPU logs using the command:
Run `cat ~/.fluvio/log/spu_log_5001.log` for spu with id `5001`

### Solution: Use an Alternative Port

To resolve the port conflict, first stop any currently running SPU if necessary. Next, start the Fluvio cluster using the `--spu=0` flag to prevent automatic SPU provisioning. Then, launch the SPU manually with your preferred port numbers. Finally, register the SPU server so it can be recognized by the cluster.


1. `fluvio cluster start --spu=0`
2. `fluvio run spu -i 5001 -p 0.0.0.0:9020 -v 0.0.0.0:9021 --log-base-dir ~/.fluvio/data > ~/.fluvio/log/spu_log_5001.log 2>&1 &`
3. `fluvio cluster spu register  --id 5001 --public-server localhost:9020 --private-server localhost:9021`

## Producer

### Max Record Size Exceeded

if you are having issues with the producer, like the error `record size (35707200 bytes), exceeded maximum request size (33554432 bytes)` you can increase the maximum record size by setting the `max_record_size` parameter in the producer command.

```yaml
fluvio produce hello-node --max-request-size 37748736
```

# Fluvio Client Disconnects

If you frequently experience Fluvio client disconnects or reconnects for either
the producer, consumer, or both, you may see error messages like:

- `Error: the produce request retry timeout limit reached`
- `Error: Reconnecting to stream consumer`

These issues often stem from network reliability or insufficient async task
scheduling time.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Network Connectivity**:
   - Review network logs to ensure a stable connection to the Fluvio cluster.

2. **Verify CPU Allocation**:
   - Ensure sufficient CPUs are allocated to the application and the async
   runtime. Running all async tasks on a single CPU can starve the Fluvio
   client, causing timeouts and reconnections.

3. **Inspect Async Runtime Configuration**:
   - If using the Tokio crate, ensure the `full` or `rt-multi-thread` feature is
   enabled in your `Cargo.toml`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
     ```

For more details on handling CPU-bound tasks, refer to the Tokio documentation
on [CPU bound tasks].
