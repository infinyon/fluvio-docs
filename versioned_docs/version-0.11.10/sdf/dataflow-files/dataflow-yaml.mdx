# Dataflow File (dataflow.yaml)

The `dataflow file` defines the end-to-end composition <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph" target="_blank">DAG</a> of the data-streaming application. At its core, the file defines sources, schemas, services, and destinations. Each service represents a flow that has one or more sources, one or more operators, and one or more destinations.

## Running a Dataflow

The [sdf] command line tool runs a dataflow locally. The tool can be used to run the dataflow locally or InfinyOn Cloud.

Navigate to the directory with the `dataflow.yaml` and run the following command:

```bash
$ sdf run
```

The command provisions a runtime environment and executes the dataflow.

If you've added `dev` section to overwrite package defaults, you need to use `sdf run --dev` for the changes to be applied.

## Dataflow Architecture

A dataflow is divided into two areas: [metadata definitions](#metadata-definitions) and [service composition](#service-composition-dag).


### Metadata Definitions

Metadata definitions help the engine provision the runtime environment for the service composition and execution. The metadata definitions are as follows:

* [apiVersion](#apiversion)
* [meta](#meta)
* [imports](#imports)
* [config](#config)
* [types](#types)
* [topics](#topics)

Each of these types are defined in detail below.


### Service Composition (DAG)

The service composition is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of services that can be chained sequentially or in parallel. In an event-driven system such as fluvio, all operations are triggered by events that flow through topics. The services are chained in parallel when they read from the topic or in sequence when the output of one service is the input of another. A service may define a sequence of operators, where each operator has an independent state machine.

In this example, Service-X and Service-Y form a parallel chain, whereas Service-Y and Service-Z form a sequential chain.

The [Services Section] defines the different types of services the engine supports.


## `dataflow.yaml` template

The dataflow file is defined in YAML and has the following hierarchy:

```yaml
apiVersion: <version>

meta:
  name: <dataflow-name>
  version: <dataflow-version>
  namespace: <dataflow-namespace>

imports:
  - pkg: <package-namespace>/<package-name>@<package-version>
    types:
      - name: <type-name>
    functions:
      - name: <function-name>
    states:
      - name: <state-name>

config:
  converter: <converter-props>
  consumer: <consumer-props>

types:
  <type-name>: <type-props>

topics:
  <topic-name>: <topic-props>

services:
  <service-name>:
    sources:
      -type: <topic-props>

    states:
      <state-name>: <state-props>

    transforms:
      - operator: <operator-props>

    window:
      <window-props>

    partition:
      <partition-props>

    sinks:
      - type: <topic-props>
```

Where:
* **apiVersion** - defines engine version of the dataflow file.
* **meta** - defines the name, version, and namespace of the dataflow.
* **imports** - defines the external packages (optional).
* **config** - defines global configutions (optional) - [defaults: converter: raw, default_starting_offset: end(0)].
* **types** - definess the type definitions (optional).
* **topics** - defines the topics used in the datataflow.
* **service/sources** - defines the sources this service reads from.
* **service/states** - defines the state used in the service (optional).
* **service/transforms** - defines the chain of transformations (optional).
* **service/window** - defines a window processing service (optional).
* **service/partition** - defines data partitioning (optional).
* **service/sinks** - defines the target output for the service (optional).


## Dataflow Operations

The dataflow file can compose multiple operations such as:

* **routing** with split and merge
* **shaping** with transforms operators
* **state processing** with state operators
* **window aggregates** with window operators

This section describes how to compose a dataflow file to accomplish the desired use case.


### `apiVersion`

The `apiVersion` informs the engine about the runtime version it must use to execute a particular dataflow.

```yaml
apiVersion: <version>
```

Where:

  - **apiVersion** - is the semantic version number (0.4.0)


### `meta`

Meta, short for metadata, holds the stateful dataflow properties, such as name & version.

```yaml
meta:
  name: <dataflow-name>
  version: <dataflow-version>
  namespace: <dataflow-namespace>
```

Where:

* **name** - is the name of the dataflow.
* **version** - the version number of the dataflow (semver).
* **namespace** - the namespace this dataflow belongs to.

The tuple `namespace:name` becomes the [WASM Component Model] package name.

### `imports`

The `imports` section is used to import external packages into a dataflow. A package may define one or more types, functions, and states. A dataflow can import from as many packages as needed.

```yaml
imports:
  - pkg: <package-namespace>/<package-name>@<package-version>
    types:
      - name: <type-name>
    functions:
      - name: <function-name>
    states:
      - name: <state-name>
```

Where:

* **pkg** - is the unique identifired of the package
* **types** - the list of types referenced by name.
* **functions** - the list of functions referenced by name.
* **states** - the list of states referenced by name.


### `config`

Config, short for configurations, defines the configuration parameters applied to the entire dataflow.

```yaml
config:
  converter: raw, json
  consumer:
    default_starting_offset:
      value: u64
      position: start, end
```

Where:

* **converter** - define the default serializaiton/deserialization for reading and writing events. Supported formats are: `raw` and `json`. The converter configuration can be overwritten by the topic configuration.

* **consumer** - define the default consumer configuration. Supported properties are:
  * `default_starting_offset` - define the default starting offset for the consumer. The consumer can read from `start`, `end`, or a specific offset `value`.

For example, if the dataflow configuration is as follows:

```yaml
config:
  converter: json
  consumer:
    default_starting_offset:
      value: 0
      position: end
```

All consumers start reading from the end of the datastream and parse the records from json.All producers write their records to the datastream in json.

##### Defaults

The `config` field is optional, and by default the system will read records from the `end` and decode records as `raw`.


### `types`

The types define the schema of the object used in the dataflow. The primitive types are as follows:

```bash
 null
 bool
 u8 | u16 | u32 | u64
 i8 | i16 | i32 | i64
 f32 | f64
 string
 enum
 key-value
 list
 object
```

These primitives allow you to create custom types. For example, you may define `user`, `job`, and `roles`  as follows:

```yaml
types:
  user:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
      age:
        type: u8
  job:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
      role:
        type: string
  roles:
    type: list
    items:
      type: key-value
      properties:
        key:
          type: string
        value:
          type: u32
```

Types define the data formats for topics, states, and smartmodules.


### `topics`

Dataflows use topics for internal and external communications. During the Dataflow initialization, the engine links to existing issues or creates newly defined topics before it starts the services.

The topics have a definition section that defines their schema and a provisioning section inside the [service](#services).

The topic definition can have one or more topics:

```yaml
topics:
  <topic-name>:
    schema:
      key:
        type: <type-name>
        converter: <converter-name>
      value:
        type: <type-name>
        converter: <converter-name>
```

Where:

* **topic-name** - is the name of the topic.
* **key** - is the schema definition for the record key (optional).
  * **type** - is the schema type for the key.
  * **converter** - is the converter to deserialize the key (optional - defaults to the converter in the configuration section).
* **value** - is the schema definition for the record value
  * **type** - is the schema type for the value.
  * **converter** - is the converter to deserialize the key (optional - defaults to the converter in the configuration section).


##### Example

The following example shows a couple topic definitions:

```yaml
topics:
  cars:
    schema:
      value:
        type: Car
        converter: json
  car-events:
    schema:
      key:
        type: CarLicense
      value:
        type: CarEvent
```

The [next section](#services) describes how to provision topics inside services.

### `services`

Services define the dataflow composition and the business logic. A service is composed of one or more sources, states, transforms, and sinks.

```yaml
services:
  <service-name>:
    sources:
      -type: topic
       id: <topic-name>
        transforms:
          - operator: <operator-props>

    states:
      <state-name>: <state-object> | <state-reference>

    transforms:
      - operator: <operator-props>

    window:
      <window-props>

    partition:
      <partition-props>

    sinks:
      -type: topic
       id: <topic-name>
        transforms:
          - operator: <operator-props>
```

The `sources` and the `sinks` connect the services with each other or external entities, the `states` store the internal representation of a composite object (or table), the `window` defines window processing, the `partition` describes parallelism, and the `transforms` define the business logic.

Window, and partitions are sections with nested keywords described in the [Services] and [Operators] sections.
