# InfinyOn Cloud Quickstart

This guide will outline using the [Fluvio CLI] with [InfinyOn Cloud] or a local [Fluvio Cluster].

1. [Install Fluvio Client (CLI)](#1-installing-fluvio-client-cli)
2. [Create an InfinyOn Cloud Account](#2-create-an-infinyon-cloud-account)
2. [Start a Cluster](#3-start-a-cluster)
3. [Produce & Consume Records](#4-produce-and-consume-records)
4. [Use Connectors](#5-use-connectors)
5. [Use StartModules](#6-use-smartmodules)
6. [Build Stateful Dataflows](#6-build-stateful-dataflows)

Let's get started.

## 1. Installing Fluvio Client (CLI)

You'll need to download and install the CLI.

```bash copy="fl"
$ curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash
```

This command will download the Fluvio Version Manager (fvm), Fluvio CLI (fluvio) and config files into `$HOME/.fluvio`, with the executables in `$HOME/.fluvio/bin`. To complete the installation, you must add the executables to your shell `$PATH`.


## 2. Create an InfinyOn Cloud Account

Head over to the [InfinyOn Cloud sign-up page] and create an account. Depending on which method you choose in account creation, you can log in with OAuth2 or username/password.

Login to InfinyOn Cloud using **Oauth**:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud login --use-oauth2
A web browser has been opened at https://infinyon-cloud.us.auth0.com/activate?user_code=GLMC-QDDJ.
Please proceed with authentication.
```

Or, login with your **Username/Password**:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud login
InfinyOn Cloud email: john@example.com
Password:
```


## 3. Start a Cluster

Use [Fluvio CLI] to start a cluster on InfinyOn Cloud. Start cluster on **InfinyOn Cloud** (must be logged in as intructed in [section 2](#2-create-an-infinyon-cloud-account)):

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud cluster create
```

Run the following command to check the CLI and the cluster platform versions:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio version
```


## 4. Produce and Consume records

### Create your first topic

Topics are used to store data and send data streams.

You can create a topic with the following command:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio topic create quickstart-topic
```

Where `quickstart-topic` is the name of your topic

Read more [about Topics in the Fluvio docs].


### Produce data to your topic

You can send data (aka *produce*) to your topic.

Let's try to produce text to your topic interactively:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio produce quickstart-topic
> hello world!
Ok!
```

Typing anything and then pressing `Enter` will send a record to your topic.

Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the interactive producer prompt.

:::tip
  You may also use the following commands:

  ```bash copy="fl"
  $ fluvio produce quickstart-topic
  > hello world!
  Ok!
  ```

  Or pipe output to `fluvio`:

  ```bash copy="fl"
  echo "hello world!" | fluvio produce quickstart-topic
  ```
:::

Read more [about Producers in the Fluvio docs].


### Consume data from your topic

You can read data (aka *consume*) from your topic.

This command will create a consumer that listens to your topic for new records and then prints it to the screen:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume quickstart-topic
Consuming records from the end of topic 'quickstart-topic'. This will wait for new records
```

To see this in action, open another terminal and produce new data.

To see previously sent data, you can add an option to your consume command to request a starting offset with the `-B <offset>` flag.

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume quickstart-topic -B -d
hello world!
```

**Flags**:
* `-B` - reads from the beginning of the stream (defaults to `0` if no value supplied).
* `-d` - closes the consumer connection after all data has been sent.

Read more [about Consumers in the Fluvio docs].


## 5. Use Connectors

InfinyOn offers [a growing number of connectors] to communicate with external services.
In this example, we will be covering the [HTTP Source] connector. The connector polls data from an HTTP endpoint that returns [a random quote] every 3 seconds to a topic called `quotes`.

Save the following configuration file on your machine:

```yaml
# quotes-source-connector.yml
apiVersion: 0.1.0
meta:
  version: x.y.z
  name: http-quotes
  type: http-source
  topic: quotes
http:
  endpoint: https://demo-data.infinyon.com/api/quote
  interval: 3s
```

You may run the connector on InfinyOn Cloud, or your local machine.


### Run HTTP Connector on InfinyOn Cloud

To start a connector in **InfinyOn Cloud**, use the following command:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector create -c quotes-source-connector.yml
```

Use the following command to see the connector status.

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector list
 NAME                 TYPE               VERSION  CDK  STATUS   LOG-LEVEL
 http-quotes          http-source        x.y.z    V3   Running  info
```

We can monitor new data in the connector's topic with `fluvio consume quotes`

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume quotes
Consuming records from 'quotes'
{"quote":"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.","by":"Albert Einstein"}
{"quote":"Whatever you are, be a good one.","by":"Abraham Lincoln"}
{"quote":"You can't build a reputation on what you're going to do.","by":"Henry Ford"}
{"quote":"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.","by":"Winston Churchill"}
```

You may delete your cloud connector with the following command: `fluvio cloud connector delete http-quotes`.

Read more [about Connectors in the Fluvio docs].


## 6. Use SmartModules

SmartModules are user-defined functions compiled into [WebAssembly] and applied to data streaming for inline data manipulation. You can use SmartModules in the producers, consumers, as well as Connectors. InfinyOn has several pre-compiled SmartModules that you can use out of the box. Alternatively, you use [SmartModule Developer Kit (smdk)] to build your own.


### Download a Smartmodule from the Hub

InfinyOn Hub has a growing library of SmartModules available for download:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio hub smartmodule list
  SMARTMODULE                              Visibility
  infinyon-labs/array-map-json@x.y.z       public
  infinyon-labs/dedup-filter@x.y.z         public
  infinyon-labs/json-formatter@x.y.z       public
  infinyon-labs/key-gen-json@x.y.z         public
  infinyon-labs/regex-map-json@x.y.z       public
  infinyon-labs/regex-map@x.y.z            public
  infinyon-labs/rss-json@x.y.z             public
  infinyon-labs/stars-forks-changes@x.y.z  public
  infinyon/jolt@x.y.z                      public
  infinyon/json-sql@x.y.z                  public
  infinyon/regex-filter@x.y.z              public
```

In the example, we'll use a [SmartModule called jolt] to turn json records into sentences.

Let's download the Smartmodule to our cluster:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio hub smartmodule download infinyon/jolt@x.y.z
... cluster smartmodule install complete
```

Check the cluster to ensure it has been successfully downloaded:

```bash copy="fl"
$  fluvio smartmodule list
  SMARTMODULE          SIZE
  infinyon/jolt@x.y.z  611.5 KB
```

Next, we'll create a transform file and test the output.


### Create a SmartModule transformation file

SmartModules can be chained together and often require additional parameters. Fluvio uses a YAML file is used to define the transformations.

Create a `tranforms.yaml` file and copy/paste the following definition:

```yaml
# File: tranforms.yaml
transforms:
  - uses: infinyon/jolt@x.y.z
    with:
      spec:
        - operation: shift
          spec:
            quote: ""
```

Jolt is a complex Smartmodule that allows you to perform multiple types of JSON transformations. For additional information, check out the [SmartModule Jolt] docs.


### Test the SmartModule

As the `quotes` are readily available for us in the `quotes` topic, we'll use the consumer command to test this SmartModule.

```bash copy="fl"
$  fluvio consume quotes --transforms-file tranforms.yaml -T=2
Consuming records from 'quotes' starting 2 from the end of log
"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
```

We are consuming the last two quotes topic records and transforming the json into a string.


### Apply the Smartmodule to the Connector

Let's say we don't use the authors in the quotes; instead, only the quote represented strings. We can accomplish this result by simply applying the transformation to the connector.

Let's create a new `http-source` connector and add the transformation:

```yaml
# string-quotes-source-connector.yml
apiVersion: 0.1.0
meta:
  version: x.y.z
  name: string-quotes
  type: http-source
  topic: string-quotes
http:
  endpoint: https://demo-data.infinyon.com/api/quote
  interval: 3s
transforms:
  - uses: infinyon/jolt@x.y.z
    with:
      spec:
        - operation: shift
          spec:
            quote: ""
```

Ready to run the connector:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector create -c string-quotes-source-connector.yml
```

Use the following command to see the connector status.

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector list
 NAME                 TYPE               VERSION  CDK  STATUS   LOG-LEVEL
 string-quotes        http-source        x.y.z    V3   Running  info
 http-quotes          http-source        x.y.z    V3   Running  info
```

Let's take a look at `string-quotes`

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume string-quotes
Consuming records from 'string-quotes'
"It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up."
"Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom."
```

We now have two topics running in parallel and producing different results with a simple SmartModule transformation. When you apply inline transformations, the number of possibilities is virtually endless.


## 6. Build Stateful Dataflows

Stateful Dataflows is currently in preview. With stateful dataflows, you can chain services, accumulate state, and perform window-based aggregates.

Checkout [SDF section] for additional information.

## Clean-up Resources

During this tutorial, we've created connectors that continue generating traffic to our cloud cluster. Run the following commands to clean up:

```bash copy="fl"
fluvio cloud connector delete http-quotes
fluvio cloud connector delete string-quotes
fluvio topic delete quotes
fluvio topic delete string-quotes
```
