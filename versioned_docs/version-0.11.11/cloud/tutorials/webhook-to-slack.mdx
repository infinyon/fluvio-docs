description: "Event data pipeline that recevies events from an InfinyOn Cloud Webhook and sends an alert to Slack"
---

This guide shows an end-to-end event pipeline that reads an event from a webhook, generates a formatted string, and publishes the result to Slack. While this is a simple example, it has many event notification use cases, such as:

* submission from website forms (via [Cloudflare workers] or your custom backend).
* activity from e-commerce platforms on purchases and shopping carts.
* notifications from github on your projects' activities.
* alerts from financial products on your transactions.
* notifications from any product that can invoke a webhook.

This pipeline uses the following features:

* [webhook]: that creates a public API to receive external events, transform them, and publish them to a topic.
* [http-sink]: that listens to the same topic and publishes them on Slack.


## Objective

Show an example of how to build an event streaming pipeline that receives webhook events, transforms the input into a readable form, and generates an alert. We assume the events are generated by a user submitting a form, and we'll format it accordingly.

## Prerequisites

* [Fluvio CLI] installed locally
* Account on [InfinyOn Cloud]

## Step-by-Step

1. [Create webhook configuration file](#create-webhook-configuration-file)
2. [Create http-sink configuration file](#create-http-sink-configuration-file)
3. [Download SmartModules](#download-smartmodules)
4. [Start Webhook and Connector](#start-webhook-and-connector)
5. [Test Data Pipeline](#test-data-pipeline)

### Create webhook configuration file

Create a webhook configuration file called `form-webhook.yaml`:

:::info
All versions are marked with `x.y.z`. To find the latest version, run:
*  `fluvio hub connector list`
*  `fluvio hub smartmodule list`
:::

```yaml title="quotes-source-connector.yml"
meta:
  name: form-webhook
  topic: form-events
webhook:
  outputParts: body
  outputType: json
transforms:
  - uses: infinyon-labs/json-formatter@x.y.z
    with:
      spec:
        match:
          - key: "/type"
            value: "subscribe"
            format:
              with: "ðŸ“¢ {} ({}) subscribed on {}"
              using:
                - "/name"
                - "/email"
                - "/source"
              output: "/formatted"
          - key: "/type"
            value: "use-case"
            format:
              with: ":confetti_ball: {} ({}) wants to solve the following '{}' use-case:\n>{}"
              using:
                - "/name"
                - "/email"
                - "/source"
                - "/description"
              output: "/formatted"
        default:
          format:
            with: "{} ({}) submitted a request"
            using:
              - "/name"
              - "/email"
            output: "/formatted"
```

The webhook reads the JSON body, applies the `json-formatter` smartmodule to generate readable text, and writes the new record to a topic called `form-events`. Checkout [labs-json-formatter-sm] in github for additional information.


### Create http-sink configuration file

Create an HTTP source connector configuration file called `slack-form-alerts.yaml` :

```yaml title="slack-form-alerts.yaml"
apiVersion: 0.1.0
meta:
  version: x.y.z
  name: slack-form-alerts
  type: http-sink
  topic: form-events
  secrets:
    - name: SLACK_USER_ALERTS
http:
  endpoint: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/${{ secrets.SLACK_USER_ALERTS }}"
  headers:
    - "Content-Type: application/json"
transforms:
  - uses: infinyon/jolt@x.y.z
    with:
      spec:
        - operation: shift
          spec:
            "formatted": "text"
```

The sink connector reads from the `form-events` topic and uses the `jolt` smartmodule to shift the formatted string into a field called `text` per the Slack instructions. Checkout [fluvio-jolt] in github for additional information.

#### Add Slack webhook token to InfinyOn Secrets

The Slack webhook link is sensitive information, let's add the [Access Token] part to `secret` in [InfinyOn Cloud] :

```bash
$ fluvio cloud secret set SLACK_USER_ALERTS <webhook-token>
```

Check out [Slack Webhooks] on how to create the webhook token.


### Download SmartModules

Download the smartmodules used by the webhook ad the connector:

```bash
$ fluvio hub download infinyon/jolt@x.y.z
$ fluvio hub download infinyon-labs/json-formatter@x.y.z
```

Check `fluvio smartmodule list` to ensure they've been downloaded.


### Start Webhook and Connector

Start webhook listener:

```bash
$ fluvio cloud webhook create --config form-webhook.yaml
```
Check `fluvio cloud webhook list` to ensure it has been successfully provisioned. In checkout the webhook link that we'll use to test the pipeline: `https://infinyon.cloud/webhooks/v1/[token]`


Start sink connector:

```bash
$ fluvio cloud connector create -c slack-form-alerts.yaml
```

Check `fluvio cloud connector list` to ensure it has been successfully provisioned.


### Test Data Pipeline

Use `curl` to send a POST request with a fictious user request to our webhook link. In production environments, this iw what a website would send:

```bash
$ curl -X POST https://infinyon.cloud/webhooks/v1/<token> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "email": "alice@acme.com", "name": "Alice Liddell", "type": "subscribe", "source": "front-page" }'
```

The following alert is displayed in Slack:

```bash
`ðŸ“¢ Alice Liddell ("alice@acme.com) subscribed on front-page` will show-up in your slack channel.
```
That's all folks!
