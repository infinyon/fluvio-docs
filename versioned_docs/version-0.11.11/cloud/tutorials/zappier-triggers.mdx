# How to Link Zapier and InfinyOn Cloud

If you're using both Zapier and InfinyOn Cloud, integrating the two can supercharge your workflows. Zapier's automation prowess can link up with InfinyOn Cloud's robust data streaming, allowing you to move and transform data and trigger actions seamlessly between them. This can not only save you time but also unlock new possibilities for your real-time data.

To follow along in this guide you need:
* Access to Zapier Premium apps
* InfinyOn Cloud cluster
* Google Forms trigger to Zapier
* Google Sheets trigger to Zapier

## Linking Zapier to InfinyOn Cloud

This section covers sending events from Zapier Zaps to InfinyOn Cloud Webhooks.

### Pre-requisites
* An [InfinyOn Cloud] account
* `fluvio` CLI installed connected to Cloud account with `fluvio cloud login`
* A Zapier account with access to [Zapier Webhooks]
* A Zap trigger. This example will use new survey responses from Google Forms

### On InfinyOn cloud cluster
First step is to create a webhook in Infinyon Cloud.

Copy the following example webhook config file and save as `example-webhook.yaml`


```yaml title="example-webhook.yaml"
meta:
  name: from-zapier
  topic: zapier-events

# optional
webhook:
  outputParts: body
  outputType: json
```

Then run `fluvio cloud webhook create` to create the webhook


```shell
$ fluvio cloud webhook create --config example-webhook.yaml
Webhook "zapier-events" created with url: https://infinyon.cloud/webhooks/v1/[random string]
```

We'll use the url for the next step in Zapier

### In Zapier dashboard

* First thing is to create or modify an existing Zap. - We've created a new Zap that triggers whenever a new response to our Google Form survey arrives
  * We won't cover the configuration of Google Form trigger further in this example

#### Configuring Webhooks step

* Add a step and choose the `Webhooks by Zapier` action
<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-webhooks-app.png" style={{ maxWidth: '60%', }} />

* Under **App & Event**, select a `POST` event and click continue
<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-form-zap-forms-app-event.png" style={{ maxWidth: '60%', }} />

* Under **Action**, for the `URL` field, paste the URL for your InfinyOn Cloud webhook
* Map the answers from survey with keys to form into json to InfinyOn Cloud and click the continue button

<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-form-zap-action.png" style={{ maxWidth: '60%', }} />

### Test the Zapier to InfinyOn Cloud workflow
Test the event gets sent to InfinyOn Cloud
In a terminal create a CLI consumer for the webhook's with the following command:


```shell
$ fluvio consume zapier-events
Consuming records from 'zapier-events'
```

In our example, we have two fields
<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-form-survey.png" style={{ maxWidth: '60%', }} />

Send a new Google Form response
<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-form-survey-submit.png" style={{ maxWidth: '60%', }} />

Then click the Test Step/Retest button test triggering the event with our survey response from the previous step.

<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-form-zap-webhooks-test.png" style={{ maxWidth: '60%', }} />

In our consumer terminal, we get this example output:

```shell
$ fluvio consume zapier-events
Consuming records from 'zapier-events'
{"name": "Stacey Fakename", "feedback": "Yes"}
```

Then you can click Publish to save this Zap. It is ready for production! It is ready to send data to InfinyOn Cloud.

The rest of this guide will cover data flow in the opposite direction.

## Linking InfinyOn Cloud to Zapier

This covers triggering Zapier Zaps with InfinyOn Cloud's outbound HTTP Connector

### Pre-requisites
* An [InfinyOn Cloud] account
* `fluvio` CLI installed connected to Cloud account with `fluvio cloud login`
* Zapier account with access to [Zapier Webhooks]
* An action to save event from a trigger (We're using Google Sheets)

### In Zapier dashboard

1. In Zapier, create a new Zap that is triggered by webhook. Copy the Zapier url for the next step
  * For our example action we will add a row per InfinyOn Cloud event into an existing Google Sheet with 2 columns

<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-event-zap-app-event.png" style={{ maxWidth: '50%', }} />

In the Test section, copy the url. We need this webhook url to configure InfinyOn Cloud as a data source for this Zap.

<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-event-zap-trigger-catch-top.png" style={{ maxWidth: '60%', }} />

We'll pause on configuring this Zap for a moment, and be back after the next section.

### On InfinyOn Cloud cluster

1. In InfinyOn Cloud, we need to create an outbound HTTP connector.
  * Replace the url from the previous step for the `endpoint` field.

:::info
All versions are marked with `x.y.z`. To find the latest version, run:
*  `fluvio hub connector list`
*  `fluvio hub smartmodule list`
:::

```yaml
# zapier-connector.yaml
apiVersion: 0.1.0
meta:
  version: x.y.z
  name: zapier
  type: http-sink
  topic: cloud-event
http:
  method: POST
  endpoint: https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/########/xxxxxxx/
```

Then create the connector with the following command


```shell
$ fluvio cloud connector create -c zapier-connector.yaml
```

Data that is sent to the `cloud-event` topic will be sent as HTTP POST to the Zapier workflow.

In the next section we'll test the end to end. But first we'll send some data to test the event triggers the Zapier Zap
  * Create a CLI Producer to the connector's `cloud-event` topic


```shell
$ fluvio produce cloud-event
> {"full_name": "Stacie Fakename", "data": "Hello from Cloud"}
```

### Test the InfinyOn Cloud to Zapier workflow

Back to Zapier to edit the webhook Zap. Click Find New Records to see the data we sent from the previous step. Click the Continue with the selected record button.
<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-event-zap-trigger-catch-full.png" style={{ maxWidth: '50%', }} />

* Create a new step. Select Google Sheets
<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-sheets-app.png" style={{ maxWidth: '30%', }} />

* We want to create a new row in Sheets. Select Create Spreadsheet Row.
<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-event-zap-sheet-app-event.png" style={{ maxWidth: '50%', }} />

* In the Account section, you'll link your Google account to link to Sheets. This step won't be covered in detail

* In the Action section, select a spreadsheet with column headers, and select Refresh fields to populate the section with inputs. Map the webhook fields from the trigger to fields in the spreadsheet and click continue.
<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-event-zap-sheet-action.png" style={{ maxWidth: '50%', }} />

* In the Test section, click Test/Retest step to create a row in the spreadsheet with the webhook data.
<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-event-zap-sheet-test.png" style={{ maxWidth: '50%', }} />

* Confirm in the spreadsheet that the data is mapped into the columns.

<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-event-sheets.png" style={{ maxWidth: '50%', }} />

Then you can click Publish to save this Zap to put it into production. It is ready to trigger from InfinyOn Cloud events.

<img src="/img/docs/tutorials/zappier-triggers/zapier-event-zap-visual-editor.png" style={{ maxWidth: '50%', }} />

This is the end of the guide. You should now have bi-directional data flow between Zapier and InfinyOn Cloud.
