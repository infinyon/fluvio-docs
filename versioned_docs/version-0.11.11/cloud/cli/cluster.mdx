The `fluvio cloud cluster` family of commands is used to create, delete, and troubleshoot Fluvio clusters in cloud.

```bash
$ fluvio cloud cluster -h
```

```
$ fluvio cloud cluster
View Cluster information

Usage: fluvio cloud cluster <COMMAND>

Commands:
  create  Create a new Fluvio cluster
  delete  Delete an existing Fluvio cluster
  list    List all Fluvio clusters
  sync    Sync Fluvio cluster profile
  usage   Print cluster usage stats
```

---

## `fluvio cloud cluster create`

This command is used to provision a new cluster.

```bash
$ fluvio cloud cluster create -h
```

```
$ fluvio cloud cluster create
Create a new Fluvio cluster

Usage: fluvio cloud cluster create <NAME> [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --profile <PROFILE>  The name of the Profile to save
      --version <VERSION>  Fix the Fluvio version of this cluster (not recommended)
      --region <REGION>    The ID of the region in which to create this cluster (beta)
```

Choosing a non-default region with `--region` is currently in private beta and not available to the public.

Specifying `--version` fixes the Fluvio version and prevents the cluster from being auto-upgraded. This is for installing experimental releases and not generally recommended.

```bash
$ fluvio cloud cluster sync -h
```
