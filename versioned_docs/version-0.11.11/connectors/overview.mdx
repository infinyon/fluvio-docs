# Connectors Overview

Fluvio Connectors make the process of importing or exporting data simple.
You can import data with an `Inbound` connector and export data with an `Outbound` connector.

Inbound and outbound connectors fundamentally work in the same way. The only difference is the direction your data is streaming with respect to a Fluvio topic.
