# The Hub

InfinyOn Hub is a collection of [Connectors](#connectors), [SmartModules](#smartmodules) and [Stateful Dataflows](#stateful-dataflows) utilized by the Fluvio platform to create realt-time data pipelines. While this is a list of certified components, the Hub allows you to publish your own componets.

## Connectors

Retrieve the list of connectors:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio hub connector list
```

#### Inbound Connectors (source)

* [HTTP](./connectors/inbound/http)
* [MQTT](./connectors/inbound/mqtt)
* [Kafka](./connectors/inbound/kafka)

#### Outbound Connectors (sink)

* [HTTP](./connectors/outbound/http)
* [SQL](./connectors/outbound/sql)
* [Kafka](./connectors/outbound/kafka)
* [Graphite](./connectors/outbound/graphite)
* [DuckDB (experimental)](./connectors/outbound/duckdb)

## SmartModules

Retrieve the list of smartmodules:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio hub smartmodule list
```

* [Filter](./smartmodules/filter)
* [Map](./smartmodules/map)
* [FilterMap](./smartmodules/filter_map)
* [ArrayMap](./smartmodules/array_map)

## Stateful Dataflows
