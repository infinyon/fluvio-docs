# Prerequisites

This guide uses `local` Fluvio cluster. If you need to install it, please follow the instructions [here][installation]!


# Introduction

Building on the [Streaming from HTTP Source] tutorial, we will customize the Source HTTP Connector with transformation that will let you modify the records before they are sent to the topic.

Why would you want to do this? 

Often, you are only interested in a subset of the data, or add/remove fields, or even change the shape of the record. This is where transformations come in.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to customize the HTTP Source Connector to add a field to every record before it is sent to the topic.


# SmartModule

SmartModule is a reusable piece of code that can be attached to a connector to perform a specific task. In this case, we will use a SmartModule to transform the incoming JSON records before they are sent to the topic.

SmartModule is executed using WebAssembly runtime, which means it is very small and secure. You can write your own SmartModules in Rust, or use the prepackaged ones from the [SmartModule Hub].

Unlike connectors, SmartModules in the Hub are packaged WASM files. 

The SmartModule we will use in this tutorial implements domain specific language (DSL) called [Jolt], to specify a transformation of input JSON to another shape of JSON data.

To use jolt SmartModule, we need to download it to the cluster.

```bash
$ fluvio hub sm download infinyon/jolt@0.4.1
```

Once you have the SmartModule downloaded, you can list them:

```bash
$ fluvio hub sm list
  SMARTMODULE          SIZE     
  infinyon/jolt@0.4.1  589.3 KB 
```


# Customizing HTTP Connector with JOLT SmartModule

In order to customize the HTTP Source Connector, we need to create a configuration file that includes the transformation.

Before we start modified connector, please terminate existing running connector.

Coyp and paste following config and save it as `http-cat-facts-transform.yaml`.   This configuration use the same endpoint as the previous tutorial except different topic name.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import CatFactBasic from '!!raw-loader!./config/http-cat-fact-transform.yaml';

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{CatFactBasic}</CodeBlock>

Noticed that we just added `transforms` section which added JOLT specification to insert a new field `source` with value `http` to every record.

Once you have the config file, you can create the connector using the `cdk deploy start` command as before.  

```bash
$ cdk deploy start --ipkg infinyon-http-source-0.3.8.ipkg --config ./http-cat-facts-transform.yaml
```


You can use `cdk deploy list` to view the status of the connector.

```bash
$ cdk deploy list
 NAME       STATUS  
 cat-facts  Running 
```

# Checking the data

Similar to the previous tutorial, we can use `fluvio consume` to view the incoming data in the topic `cat-facts-transformed` which was created by the connector.

```bash
$ fluvio consume cat-facts -T4
Consuming records starting 4 from the end of topic 'cat-facts'

{"fact":"Heat occurs several times a year and can last anywhere from 3 to 15 days.","length":73,"source":"http"}
{"fact":"Cats prefer to remain non-confrontational. They will not fight to show dominance, but rather to stake their territory. Cats will actually go to extremes to avoid one another in order to prevent a possible confrontation.","length":219,"source":"http"}
{"fact":"Cats only sweat through their paws and nowhere else on their body","length":65,"source":"http"}
{"fact":"Unlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth. Scientists believe this is due to a mutation in a key taste receptor.","length":114,"source":"http"}
```
As you can see, the `source` field has been added to every record. This is the transformation we added to the connector.

You can terminate the consume command by pressing `Ctrl+C`.


### Cleaning up

Shut down the connector and delete the topic.

```bash
$ cdk deploy shutdown --name cat-facts-transformed
$ fluvio topic delete cat-facts-transform
```

## Conclusion and Next Step

In this tutorial, we showed you how to customize the HTTP Source Connector with transformation using SmartModule.  

SmartModule is a powerful tool that can be used to perform complex transformations on the incoming data.  

In the next tutorial, we will show you how to use the sink connector to stream data from an topic to a SQL database.
