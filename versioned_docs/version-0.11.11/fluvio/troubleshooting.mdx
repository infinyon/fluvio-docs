This document will help you troubleshoot common issues with your Fluvio cluster.

## Troubleshooting a Local Cluster


To troubleshoot a local Fluvio cluster, you can check the logs of the SC and SPUs processes.

- Run `cat ~/.fluvio/log/flv_sc.log` for SC logs
- Run `cat ~/.fluvio/log/spu_log_XXXX.log` for each SPU
  - E.g. when running 1 SPU, there will be `spu_log_5001.log`

You can also use `tail -n 100 ~/.fluvio/log/flv_sc.log` to just print the last 100 lines of the log file.

### Log directory

By default, Fluvio logs are stored in the `~/.fluvio/log` directory. 
But if you have the `FLUVIO_DIR` environment variable set, the logs will be stored in the directory specified by the variable.

### Setting log level

You can set various log levels as [filering tracing log].

For example, to start cluster using log level `info` using cluster start

```bash
$ fluvio cluster start --rust-log=info
```

For individual binaries, you can use `RUST_LOG` env variable:

```bash
$ RUST_LOG=info fluvio run sc --local
```

The log level can be set to `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.
