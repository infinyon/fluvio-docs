# The `sdf run` command

Run the project and open the command line in interactive mode with `sdf run`:

```bash
$ sdf run -h
Run Stateful Dataflow

Usage: sdf run [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --ui           start the workflow viewer ui [env: UI=]
  -p, --port <PORT>  port for web server to listen on [env: PORT=] [default: 8000]
```

Use `--ui` to view a graphical represetation of the project in a web browser. The default port is `8000`, and you may change it with the `--port` flag.


##### Example

Navigate to the project directory, ensure it's built, and `run` to start the project in interactive mode:


```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf run --ui
Please visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 to use SDF Studio
...
```

### Interactive Mode

SDF `run` opens the command line in interactive mode:

```bash
>> -h
SDF - Stateful Dataflow CLI

Usage: <COMMAND>

Commands:
  show  Show or List states. Use `show state --help` for more info
  exit  Stop interactive session
```

### `>> show state`

Use `show state` to peak into the internal state objects managed by the system:

Command line syntax for `show state`:

```bash
>> show state -h
List all states or show state for given key

Usage: show state [OPTIONS] [NAMESPACE]

Arguments:
  [NAMESPACE]  namespace of state

Options:
      --key <KEY>        key of state
      --filter <FILTER>  filter regex
```

##### Example

For example, to show all state objects:

```bash copy="fl"
>> show state
 Namespace                                     Keys  Type
 word-processing-window/count-per-word/state   22    u32
 word-processing-window/sentence/topic.offset  1     offset
```

The states are organized by namespace where the first keyword is the service name `word-processing-window`, followed by the function name `count-per-word` or topic `sentence`. The `state` is the temporary result computed by the window function, whereas `topic.offset` is the offset of the last record read from the `sentence` topic.

To further inspect the objects, use the `show state` command with the name of the namespace:


```bash copy="fl"
>> show state word-processing-window/count-per-word/state
 Key       Value  Window
 book      1      2023-12-28T00:32:00Z:2023-12-28T00:32:20Z
 but       1      2023-12-28T00:32:00Z:2023-12-28T00:32:20Z
...
```

You also have the option to filter the state by key `(--key)`, or a regex `(--filter)` operation.


### `>> exit`

Exit interactive mode:


```bash copy="fl"
>> exit
bye!
```
