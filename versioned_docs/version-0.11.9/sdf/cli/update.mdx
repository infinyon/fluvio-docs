# The `sdf update` command

Command line syntax for `sdf update`:

```bash
$ sdf update -h
Update sdf project

Usage: sdf update [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -f, --force    force to apply all updates
  -d, --dry-run  print changes and exit
```

This command is used to update the project based on updated in the `data-pipeline.yaml` file.

The update command makes code changes that cannot be reversed. As a safety measure, the command generates a `diff` and asks for confirmation before proceeding. If you want to bypass the confirmation prompt, use the `-f` and `-d` flags.
