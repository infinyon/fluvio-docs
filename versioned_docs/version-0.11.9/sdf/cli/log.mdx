# The `sdf log` command

Use `sdf log` to view you print statements:

```bash
$  sdf log -h
Print data pipeline logs

Usage: sdf log [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -f, --follow  Specify if the logs should be streamed
```

Use `--f --follow` option to watch the logs.


##### Example

The following code splits sentences into words and has a `println` statement:

```yaml
- operator: flat-map
  run: |
    fn split_sentence(sentence: String) -> Result<Vec<String>, String> {
      let result = sentence.split_whitespace().map(String::from).collect();
      println!("{:?}", result);

      Ok(result)
    }
```

For the sentence with `This is a test`, the output will be:


```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf log
2024-01-06T02:08:09.735861+00:00 split-sentence INFO ["This", "is", "a", "test"]
```
