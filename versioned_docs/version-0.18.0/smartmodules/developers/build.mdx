This section covers building and testing SmartModules locally, and the [next section] describes how to load them on the Cluster for live traffic testing.


### Build - Operation

Navigate to `my-filter` project directory and run `build`:

```bash copy="fl"
$ smdk build
...
Compiling my-filter v0.1.0 (~/smdk/my-filter)
Finished release-lto [optimized] target(s) in 12.65s
```

The build process generated an binary optimized for WebAssembly. We are now ready to test it.

### Test - Operation

When testing a SmartModule you can provide the test input via direct `text`, specifying a `file`,
or reading from the `stdin`.

Let's perform the matching test for our `my-filter` that looks for letter `a`:

```bash copy="fl"
$ smdk test --text cat
loading module at: ~/smdk/my-filter/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release-lto/my_filter.wasm
1 records outputted
cat
```

Next, a non-matching test, reading the input from the `stdin`:

```bash copy="fl"
$ echo -n dog | smdk test --stdin
loading module at: ~/smdk/my-filter/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release-lto/my_filter.wasm
0 records outputted
```

Checkout the `smdk test -h` for additional parameters.

Checkout the [next section] on how upload the SmartModule to your local cluster or [InfinyOn Cloud] for live traffic testing.
