# Fluvio Installation

Fluvio runs in a number of different contexts. From directly on your
computer in for **local** tryout and development, to containerized in Docker, to Kubernetes environments.

Starting out in a **local** run environment is the simplest and recommended
for initially trying out Fluvio and SDF.  From there you may want to deploy to production with **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, or we also offer **Cloud** hosted
Fluvio/SDF.
