## Dataframe states

States are a key concept in SDF. They hold a simple value or they can be divided into multiple partitions based on a key.  Each partition state can have many different types.  

One of the type is `arrow-row`.  For example, follow snippet define state `count_per_word` that store each row into arrow dataframe.

```yaml
    states:
      count-per-word:
        type: keyed-state
        properties:
          key:
            type: string
          value:
            type: arrow-row
            properties:
              count: 
                type: u32
```

An `arrow-row` state can be seen as an SQL table. In  the previous example, we are defining a state `count_per_word` to track frequency of the words.  For each key, we have a row that has a column `count` that store the count of the word.
For example, let's we have following word: `apple`, `orange`, `banana`, `orange`, `grape`, `orange`, `banana`.  

Then this will be mapped to arrow dataframe as follows:

| _key | count |
| --- | --- |
| apple | 2 |
| orange | 3 |
| banana | 2 |
| grape | 1 |

## Updating a Dataframe state

To update the state, you can use the `update-state` operator as below:

```yaml 
update-state:
    run: |
    fn count_word(_word: String) -> Result<()> {
        let mut state = count_per_word();
        state.count += 1;
        state.update()?;
        Ok(())
    }
```

Note that state value can be access using `count_per_word` state function which is automatically injected by SDF builder.

This API is invoked by the `update-state` operator, which only is able to update the value of the partition state.

In the example, `count_per_word` represents a row value of the dataframe.  If operator sees  `apple`, it will be the first row in the dataframe above.

## SQL function

Aggregate operators like `flush`, or external services that reference a state can perform SQL queries on the aggregated data of all partitions of a state. In order to do that, is introduced a function `sql` to the context.  The `sql` state function performs the SQL operation passed as parameter on the aggregated view of the states and not in their individual rows. The snippet below shows how to use SQL to get the 3 most frequent words.

```yaml
flush:
    run: |
        fn aggregate_wordcount() -> Result<TopWords> {

        let top3 = sql("select * from count_per_word order by count desc limit 3")?;
        let rows = top3.rows()?;

        let mut top_words = vec![];
        let key = top3.key()?;
        let count = top3.col("count")?;

        while rows.next() {
            let word = rows.str(&key)?;
            let count = rows.u32(&count)?;
            let word_count = WordCount { word, count };
            top_words.push(word_count);
        }

        Ok(top_words)
        }
```

The output of the `sql` function implements also the following methods that will be described below: sql, rows, col, key, next

## SQL API

For any state that is dataframe, you can use SQL API to perform dataframe operation.  SDF uses polars SQL to perform dataframe operations.  
The result of a SQL operation is always a dataframe.  So you can perform multiple SQL operation to get the desired result.

The SQL is executed in the context of all the available dataframes, so you can perform any JOIN or complex SQL operations with them. Each dataframe is represented as a table, and each table name is their state name replacing hyphens(-) with underscores(_) as illustrated below.

```rust
let top3 = sql("select * from count_per_word order by count desc limit 3")?;
```

## Row API

Once you have dataframe, you can use row api to access values of individual rows.  To get rows, you can use `rows` function on the dataframe.

```rust
let rows = top3.rows()?;
```

You can think of row as iterator that you can use to access individual row.  Following functions are available on row object.
To access row values, must first get columns like below:

```rust
let count = top3.col("count")?;
```

To get key, can use helper function `key`:

```rust
let key = top.key()?;
```

Use `next` function to goto next row.  If successful, it will return true.  If there are no more rows, it will return false.

```rust
while rows.next() {
    ...
}
```

As long as `next` is true, you can access current value by passing column.  Each column has type associated with it.  So you can only access values that are compatible with the column type otherwise it will return error.

For example, to get string value, you can use `str` function. To get u32 value, you can use `u32` function.

```rust
let word = rows.str(&key)?;
let count = rows.u32(&count)?;
```
