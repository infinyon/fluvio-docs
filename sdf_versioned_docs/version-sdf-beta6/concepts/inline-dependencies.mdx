 For inline operators, you can add `dependencies` section to include external language specific libraries. The dependencies are defined in the `dependencies` section of the operator definition. The dependencies are resolved by the SDF engine and made available to the operator at runtime.


 ## External Dependencies

 For Rust based operators, the dependencies are based on Rust Cargo package manager similar to `dependencies` section in [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html).

 For example, following variations are possible:

 Adding a crate with version:

 ```yaml
  - operator: map
    dependencies:
      - name: regex
        version: "1.10.0"
 ```

 Adding a git repository:

 ```yaml
  - operator: map
    dependencies:
      - name: regex
        git: "https://github.com/rust-lang/regex"
        tag: "1.10.0"
 ```

 Adding multiple dependencies:

 ```yaml
  - operator: map
    dependencies:
      - name: regex
        version: "1.10.0"
      - name: iter_tools
        version: "0.15.0"
 ```

 Once the dependencies are added, inline operator can use the dependencies in the `run` section as in the typical Rust code as example below which tries to validate the year format.

 ```yaml
 - operator: filter
   dependencies:
     - name: regex
       version: "1.10.0"
   run: |
     fn validate_year(input: String) -> Result<bool> {
         use std::sync::OnceLock;
         use regex::Regex;

         static REGEX: OnceLock<Regex> = OnceLock::new();

         let re = REGEX.get_or_init(|| Regex::new(r"^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$").unwrap());
         Ok(re.is_match(&input))
     }
 ```


 ## InfinyOn Dependencies

 The Stateful Dataflow requires external dependencies to invoke an HTTP call-out and other operations.

 ### HTTP Callout

 The http callout function makes it easy to make HTTP requests from your service operator. The call-out library is based on the `reqwest` library.  To use the http callout, add a git dependency in your operator definition.

 ```yaml
 - operator: map
   dependencies:
       - name: sdf-http
         git: "https://github.com/infinyon/sdf-http-guest"
         tag: "v0.4.0"
 ```

 Following snippet takes a sentence and translate english to spanish using external API.   The [Request](https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.11.24/reqwest/struct.Request.html) is part of `reqwest` library and `sdf_http::blocking::send` is used to send the request.


 ```yaml
 - operator: map
   dependencies:
       - name: sdf-http
         git: "https://github.com/infinyon/sdf-http-guest"
         tag: "v0.4.0"
   run: |
     fn english_to_spanish(sentence: String) -> Result<String> {
         use  sdf_http::http::Request;

         let url = format!("https://acme.com/translate?text={}", sentence);
         let request = Request::builder().uri(url).body("")?;
         let response = sdf_http::blocking::send(request)?;
         Ok(response.into_body())
     }
 ```
