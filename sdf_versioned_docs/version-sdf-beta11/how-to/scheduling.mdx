:::info
**schedule** requires using `apiVersion: 0.6.0` or higher in your dataflow configuration.
:::

The `schedule` configuration defines recurring events that can be used as input sources for your services, enabling time-based automation.


### Structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: 0.6.0 # Requires 0.6.0 or higher
...
schedule:
  <event-name>:
    cron: "<cron-expression>"
```

### Using Scheduled Events as Service Inputs:

```yaml
services:
  <service-name>:
    sources:
      - type: schedule
        id: <event-name>
```


## Schedule configuration fields

- `<event-name>`: (String, required) A unique identifier for the scheduled event. This name is used to reference the event in service configurations.
- `cron`: (String, required) A cron expression that defines the schedule. The expression follows the standard Unix cron format:
```
* * * * *
- - - - -
| | | | |
| | | | +----- day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7)
| | | +------- month (1 - 12)
| | +--------- day of month (1 - 31)
| +----------- hour (0 - 23)
+------------- minute (0 - 59)
```
For more details on cron expressions, refer to online cron expression generators and documentation.

## Example:

This dataflow will produce a record to the `output` topic once per day at 8:00 AM

```yaml
apiVersion: 0.6.0
meta:
  name: schedule
  version: 0.1.0
  namespace: example
# default config
config:
  converter: json
  consumer:
    default_starting_offset:
      value: 0
      position: End
topics:
  output:
    name: time-events
    schema:
      value:
        type: i64
schedule:
  daily-report:
    cron: "0 8 * * *" # Trigger at 8:00 AM daily
services:
  produce-daily:
    sources:
      - type: schedule
        id: daily-report
    sinks:
      - type: topic
        id: output
```
