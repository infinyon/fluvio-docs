# Beta 5

## Upgrading 

To upgrade CLI to the beta5, run the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{InstallFvm}</CodeBlock>

To upgrade host workers, shutdown and restart the worker:

```bash
$ sdf worker shutdown <host-worker-name>
$ sdf worker create <host-worker-name>
```

For upgrading cloud workers, please contact [InfinyOn support](#infinyon-support).

## Featured change

- Added [sql mode] to interactive shell. With this change, user should be able to run SQL queries (including JOINS) in states of dataflow. The states that support the queries are the [dataframe states]. In particular, when the state has a window context, the queries are againts the last flushed state.

### CLI changes

- `sdf run` not longer accepts `--dev`. Development mode is now the default for `sdf run`. If you want to run in non-development mode use `--prod`.

### Improvements

- Added capability to run complex queries like join on states in operator context through the [sql function].
- Performance improvements.
- Improved error messages when nested types definitions are wrong.

### Changes
- Replaced dashes in tables. Previously, when the state name has dashes in it, we were escaping the state name in sql context with quotes. From sdf-beta5, we should access them using `_` instead of `-` on the table name in order to avoid the escaping.
