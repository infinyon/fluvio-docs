# `sdf log`

The `sdf logs` command prints the stream of logs produced by dataflow operators. You can filter the logs by dataflow name or operator name.

### `sdf logs` command

The `logs` command has the following hierarchy:

```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf logs -h
Print dataflow logs

Usage: sdf log [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -f, --follow               Specify if the logs should be streamed
  -t, --tail <TAIL>          the number of lines of log to fetch
      --dataflow <DATAFLOW>  filter by dataflow name
      --operator <OPERATOR>  filter by operator
  -v, --verbose              
  -h, --help                 Print help
```

Where:
* `--follow` causes the command to not stop after printing the logs.
