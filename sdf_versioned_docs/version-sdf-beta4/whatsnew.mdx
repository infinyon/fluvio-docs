# Beta 4

## Upgrading 

To upgrade CLI to the beta4, run the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{InstallFvm}</CodeBlock>

Make sure that [`wasm32-wasip2`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/wasm32-wasip2.html#wasm32-wasip2) target is installed. Typically, can be  installed via:

```bash
$ rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```

To upgrade host workers, shutdown and restart the worker:

```bash
$ sdf worker shutdown <host-worker-name>
$ sdf worker create <host-worker-name>
```

For upgrading cloud workers, please contact [InfinyOn support](#infinyon-support).

### Compatibility and Breaking changes


### CLI changes
- `sdf setup` now checks that Fluvio is running and that we can connect to it.

### Changes
- renamed [configuration used to connect to remote clusters] from `profile` to `remote_cluster_profile`.
- updated to use `wasm32-wasip2` target for building wasm modules.

## Improvements
- Support definition of [nested types].
- Performance improvements.

## Bug Fixes
- When using windows, events with an older timestamp are skipped now.
