1. Setup an Infinyon Cloud cluster by following the [Quick Start]
2. Create a topic named <strong>webdemo</strong>
    ```shell copy="fl"
    $ fluvio topic create webdemo
    ```
3. Create an access key
    ```shell copy="fl"
    $ fluvio cloud access-key create web-demo --topic webdemo
    ```
4. Start producer with access key from step 3
5. Start consumer with access key from step 3

### Producer Iframe
The producer demo app runs in a CodePen iframe. It will connect to the WebSocket Gateway and produce (x, y) values of a sine wave to the <strong>webdemo</strong> topic. This is independent of the consumer charting app and is only interacting with the Fluvio topic via the WebSocket Gateway.

### Consumer Iframe
The consumer demo app runs in a CodePen iframe. It will connect to the WebSocket Gateway and consume and chart (x, y) values from the <strong>webdemo</strong> topic. This is independent of the sine wave producer app and is only interacting with the Fluvio topic via the WebSocket Gateway.

### Watch with Fluvio CLI
The data being produced can be simultaneously consumed with the Fluvio CLI.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume webdemo
```
