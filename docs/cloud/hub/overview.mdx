Each SmartModule in the Hub is uniquely identified by a `group`, `name`, and `version`.

For example, the following SmartModules is published by `InfinyOn`:

```bash
infinyon/sql-json@x.y.z
```

### Private/Public SmartModules

SmartModules published to the Hub can be `public` or `private`. Public SmartModules are visible and downloadable by anyone, whereas private SmartModules are only visible to the owner.
