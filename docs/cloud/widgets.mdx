# Widgets

Widgets are user-published UI components that can be used to visualize data streams. By utilizing the [web components model], and leveraging [Infinyon Websocket Gateways] widgets make it easy to create custom visualizations for [Fluvio Topics] and _Infinyon Marketplace Subscriptions_, which can be used in the Infinyon Dashboard or on any webpage.

### Development

Widgets are just web components with a few specific constraints. To illustrate the constraints, consider the following source code for an example widget:

```js
class InfinyonLineGraph extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    const wsGatewayUrl = this.getAttribute('ws-gateway-url');

    connectWebSocket(wsGatewayUrl);
  }

  connectWebSocket(url) {
    this.ws = new WebSocket(url);

    this.ws.onopen = () => console.log(`Connected to WebSocket: ${url}`);
    this.ws.onmessage = (event) => console.log('Received:', event.data);
    this.ws.onerror = (error) => console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
    this.ws.onclose = () => console.log(`WebSocket closed: ${url}`);
  }
}

customElements.define('infinyon-line-graph-0-1-0', InfinyonLineGraph);
```

Every widget is a web component which expects a `ws-gateway-url` attribute to be set. When instantiated, this widget logs the websocket stream to the developer console.

This web component is a valid widget because all of the following are true:

1. The web component expects to receive a `ws-gateway-url` attribute holding a websocket url for its data source.
2. The web component has a name of the form `<org>-<name>-<version>`, where `<org>` is the publishing organization, `<name>` is a name unique to the organiation, and `<version>` is a SemVer string, delineated by hyphens instead of periods.
3. The entry point for the web component is in a file named `start.js`

**Note**: Most javascript bundling tools will generate a directory named `dist/` or `build/` with a top level javascript file named `index.js`, to use your javascript project as a widget, configure your bundler to name your entry point file `start.js`.

### Publishing

Widgets can be published to the Infinyon [Hub] to be used on the **Infinyon Dashboard** or any website. To publish a widget, create a `widget.yaml` in the root of your project.

```yaml
name: vite-react-template
organization: infinyon
version: x.y.z
visibility: public
included:
  - ./dist
entry_point: ./dist/start.js
```

This `widget.yaml` contains the same `name`, `organization`, `version` metadata as other packages in the Infinyon Ecosystem.

The `visibility` field can be set to `public` or `private`. When a `private` widget is published, the widget can only be viewed by other members of the same organization.

`included` is a list of directories which will be uploaded with the widget. This should be the root of your distribution assets.

Finally, `entry_point` is a relative path to your widget's top level `js` file. This file should define a web component, and load any other assets that are needed to run the widget.

Once the `widget.yaml` is defined, the widget can be published using the [Fluvio Cloud CLI]

```bash
$ fluvio cloud widget publish
```

### Listing

Once your widget is published, you can confirm it is available by running the `list` command:

```bash
$ fluvio cloud widget list
