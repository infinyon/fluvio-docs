Access keys allow websocket access to Infinyon Cloud clusters. Access keys are set via the CLI. Each access key has a user defined name and a generated key.

## `fluvio cloud access-key` subcommands

- create
- list
- delete
- rotate

```bash
$ fluvio cloud access-key create <NAME>
$ fluvio cloud access-key list
$ fluvio cloud access-key delete <NAME>
$ fluvio cloud access-key rotate <NAME>
```

## `fluvio cloud access-key create`

Creates an access key with the given name.

### Simple WebSocket Access Key

```bash
$ fluvio cloud access-key create <NAME> --topic <TOPIC> [--consume] [--produce]
```

This will create an access key that targets specified topic. The access key can optionally be restricted to only allow producing or consuming data by passing the `--consume` or `--produce` flag.

This access key can be used to connect via WebSocket URL `wss://infinyon.cloud/wsr/v1/simple/consume?access_key=<KEY>` for consuming and `wss://infinyon.cloud/wsr/v1/simple/produce?access_key=<KEY>` for producing.

### Fluvio over WebSocket Access Key

```bash
$ fluvio cloud access-key create <NAME> --protocol fluvio
```

This will create an access key that allows the [Fluvio WASM Client] client to connect to your cluster. The access key allows full Fluvio protocol access which can be used for producing and consuming as well as admin operations. The client will need to be configured to connect to `wss://infinyon.cloud/wsr/v1/fluvio?access_key=<KEY>`.

## `fluvio cloud access-key list`

Lists all access keys with their name and key.

```bash
$ fluvio cloud access-key list

 NAME   KEY
 demo1  T8qfLk5l6KWfpOrWYgUfHYKzKsvwjw6m
 demo2  iSmvJXJXDkyq3SgEGpsgTDv1RTaZXdQD
```


## `fluvio cloud access-key delete`

This will delete the named access key.

```bash
$ fluvio cloud access-key delete <NAME>
```


## `fluvio cloud access-key rotate`

This will generate a new key for the named access key.

```bash
$ fluvio cloud access-key rotate <NAME>
```
