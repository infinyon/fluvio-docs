This tutorial assumes that `fluvio` is installed, and logged-in to InfinyOn Cloud. Follow the [Quick Start] to get set up.

Webhooks are special connectors with an associated external url. Users can send data to their topics via a `HTTP POST` request.

## Webhook Configuration

The webhook configuration file has the following structure:

```yaml
meta:
  name: my-webhook        # required
  topic: my-webhook       # required
  logLevel: debug         # default: info, options: [trace, debug, info, warn, error]
  secrets:
    - name: my-key
  producer:
    linger: 100ms
    batch-size: 1mb
    compression: snappy    # default: none, options: [none, gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd]
webhook:
  outputParts: full        # default: body, options: [full, body]
  outputType: json         # default: text, options: [text, json]
  outputUri: full          # default: none, options: [full, none, path, query]
transforms:
  - uses: infinyon/jolt@x.y.z
    with:
      key: ${{ secrets.my_key }}
```

The minimum configuration has needs the top 2 required fields: `name` and `topic`. The `name` is the name of the webhook, and the `topic` is the topic that the webhook will publish to.


## Create a simple Webhook

Let's create an example configuration file

```yaml
# example-webhook.yaml
meta:
  name: my-webhook
  topic: my-webhook-topic
```

Add a webhook to InfinyOn Cloud

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud webhook create --config example-webhook.yaml
```

Your output should look similar to this. We'll cover sending data to this url.

```
Webhook "my-webhook" created with url: https://infinyon.cloud/webhooks/v1/[random string]
```

If you need this url again, you can run this command to list your webhooks, and their urls.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud webhook list
```

Example output

```
 NAME        TOPIC             URL
 my-webhook  my-webhook-topic  https://infinyon.cloud/webhooks/v1/[random string]
```

### Send data to webhook

We'll be sending json data `{"key": "value"}` to our webhook using `curl`. Replace the url so `[random string]` matches your unique url. Keep this command close because we'll refer to this example curl command later.

```shell copy="fl"
$ curl -v -X POST -d 'Hello World!' https://infinyon.cloud/webhooks/v1/[uri-key]
```

In another terminal, star a consumer that reads form the beginning:

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume my-webhook-topic -B
```

We should see the following output:

```bash
Hello World!
```

## Create a JSON Webhook and embed HTTP parts

Next we'll send json records, but before we do that we'll modify `outputParts`, `outputType`, and `outputUri` in the  `example-webhook.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
# example-webhook.yaml
meta:
  name: my-webhook
  topic: my-webhook-topic

webhook:
  outputParts: full
  outputType: json
  outputUri: full
```

Run this command to update your webhook.

```shell
$ fluvio cloud webhook update --config example-webhook.yaml
Webhook "my-webhook" updated
```

Let's restart the consumer to a JSON formatter:

```shell
$ fluvio consume my-webhook-topic -O json
```

Run another curl with a `json` payload:

```bash
$ curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "value"}' https://infinyon.cloud/webhooks/v1/[uri-key]
```

The consumer should now show the following output:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "key": "value"
  },
  "headers": {
    "accept": "*/*",
    "accept-encoding": "gzip, br",
    "content-length": "16",
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "host": "infinyon.cloud",
    "user-agent": "curl/x.y.z",
    "x-forwarded-for": "..."
  },
  "path": "",
  "query": ""
}
```
