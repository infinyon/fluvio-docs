This tutorial is a demonstration of mirroring locally with two clusters on docker.

## Home and Remote

To undestand mirroring, we need to undestand what is a Home and a Remote cluster:

- Home cluster is the target cluster that will receive and consume data.
- Remote cluster is the source cluster that will send data.


## Install Fluvio

### Create a Cloud account

Using your web browser, navigate to [https://infinyon.cloud/ui/signup], where this experimental feature is available.

After the account is created, you will be placed in the Dashboard. You may choose to create a cluster in the GUI. In this tutorial, we'll create a cluster using the CLI later.


### Download `fluvio` binary

Use `curl` to download and install:

```bash
curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash
```

Make sure to add `.fluvio/bin` to the `$PATH`as specified in the installation script.


### Login to InfinyOn Cloud

Login to InfinyOn Cloud:


```bash
fluvio cloud login --use-oauth2
```

Leave out `--use-oauth2` if you prefer username/password method.

### Provision a new Cluster

Let's provision a new cloud cluster


```bash
fluvio cloud cluster create
```

Check the result with:


```bash
fluvio cluster status
```

Next, we'll configure the cluster to receive traffic from the remote clusters.


### Register Remote clusters on the Home

Use the `remote` CLI to register the remote clusters with the home cluster:


```bash
fluvio remote register edge-remote
```

List remote clusters to check their status:

```bash
fluvio remote list
```

It should show the following:

```bash
  REMOTE         SC STATUS  SPU STATUS  LAST SEEN  ERRORS
  edge-remote    Waiting    Waiting     -          -
```

### Create the mirror topic

Mirror topics on the home clusters has multiple partitions, where each partition has a `1-to-1` relationship with the remote cluster.

Create a partition assignment file to define the remote devices:


```bash
echo '["edge-remote"]' > assignment_file.json
```

Apply the configuration file to create the topic:


```bash
fluvio topic create mirror-topic --mirror-apply assignment_file.json
```

List partitions to check the assignment:


```bash
fluvio partition list
```

It should display all partitions:

```bash
  TOPIC         PARTITION  LEADER  MIRROR        REPLICAS  RESOLUTION  SIZE  HW  LEO  LRS  FOLLOWER OFFSETS
  mirror-topic  0          5001    edge-remote   []        Online      0 B   0   0    0    0                 []
```

### Generate Metadata for Remote Clusters from the Cloud Cluster

Each remote cluster requires a unique metadata file that gives the remote cluster the information to connect to the home cluster and the topic/mirror where the data is synchronized.

Generate a metadata file for the remote:

```bash
fluvio cloud remote export edge-remote --file edge-remote.json
```

# Connect to the Home Cluster from the Remote

First, we'll start a local cluster: 

```bash
fluvio cluster start
```

Then, connect to the home cluster:

```bash
fluvio home connect --file edge-remote.json
```

Let's check the partitions:


```bash
fluvio partition list
```

The remote device should show the following partition::

```bash
  TOPIC         PARTITION  LEADER  MIRROR                                                                 REPLICAS  RESOLUTION  SIZE  HW  LEO  LRS  FOLLOWER OFFSETS
  mirror-topic  0          5001    c7f891c9-f1f9-4d28-b181-9777d8d07731:0:router.infinyon.cloud:9005  []        Online      0 B   0   0    0    0                 []
```


Also, check the home status with:


```bash
fluvio home status
```

It should show the following:

```bash
  HOME                                  ROUTE                       SC STATUS  SPU STATUS  LAST SEEN  ERRORS
  c7f891c9-f1f9-4d28-b181-9777d8d07731  router.infinyon.cloud:9003  Connected  Connected   1s         -
```

## Producing and Consuming on Mirroring

Let's produce on the remote and consume from the home cluster.

### Produce to remote cluster

Produce with:


```bash
fluvio produce mirror-topic
```

```bash
> A
Ok!
> B
Ok!
```


### Consume from Home cluster 

First, switch to the cloud profile:

```bash
fluvio profile switch <your-cloud-profile>
```

To know your cloud profile, run:

```bash
fluvio profile list
```

Then, consume with:

```bash
fluvio consume mirror-topic --mirror docker-remote -B
```

```bash
A
B
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You have successfully tested mirroring on the cloud.
