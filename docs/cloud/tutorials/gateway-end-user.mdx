This tutorial will walk you through setting up multi-user or multi-tenant access to a topic in Infinyon Cloud.

## Concepts

* **WebSocket Gateway**: The WebSocket Gateway allows you to produce and consume data using a WebSocket connection.
* **Access Key**: Used to authenticate the WebSocket connection. This key will only allow access to a cluster and topic specified by the Access Key. This key can be shared with multiple end users.
* **End-User Token**: A token that can be used to authenticate a end-user in addition to the Access Key. This token can be used to filter Fluvio records based on the user's identity.
* **Fluvio Record Key**: A record in Fluvio is a key-value pair. The key can be set when producing, and can contain metadata such as end user identity.
* **Key Filter**: A string that is used to filter records being consumed from the WebSocket Gateway. This filter can be used to restrict access to records based on the end user's identity. This value is checked against the Fluvio Record Key for an exact match.
* **Key Filter Server**: A HTTP server that exposes a HTTP POST endpoint which returns a Key Filter based on End-User Token.
* **Key Filter Remote URL**: The HTTPS URL of the Key Filter Server.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the Fluvio CLI is installed, and logged-in to InfinyOn Cloud. Follow the [Quick Start] to get set up.

## Create a topic

First, create a topic to interact with.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio topic create multi-user-demo
topic "multi-user-demo" created
```

## Produce records

Produce end user keyed records to the topic using the Fluvio CLI.

```shell copy="cmd"
$ echo "Message for User1" | fluvio produce multi-user-demo --key "user1"
$ echo "Message for User2" | fluvio produce multi-user-demo --key "user2"
```

Confirm that the records were produced successfully with the correct key.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume -Bdk multi-user-demo
Consuming records from 'multi-user-demo' starting from the beginning of log
[user1] Message for User1
[user2] Message for User2
```

## Set up a Key Filter Server (Rust Example)

Create a simple Key Filter Server that returns a Key Filter based on the End-User Token.

### Setup a new Rust project

Create a HTTP application server using [Actix].

```shell copy="fl"
$ cargo new key_filter_server
```

Add the `actix-web` dependency to the `Cargo.toml` file.

<CodeBlock language="toml">{ExampleToml}</CodeBlock>

Add the following code to the `src/main.rs` file.

<CodeBlock language="rust">{ExampleMain}</CodeBlock>

### Run the Key Filter Server

Run the Key Filter Server.

```shell copy="fl"
$ cargo run
```

Keep this server running in a separate terminal for the duration of this tutorial.

### Make the Key Filter Server accessible to the Infinyon Cloud WebSocket Gateway

Exposing the Key Filter Server to the internet will allow the WebSocket Gateway to fetch the Key Filter based on the End-User Token.

In this example we will use pinggy.io to expose the Key Filter Server to the internet. You may also use services such as Cloudflare tunnel and others that expose your local server to the internet over HTTPS.

```shell copy="fl"
$ ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:4000 a.pinggy.io
You are not authenticated.
Your tunnel will expire in 60 minutes. Upgrade to Pinggy Pro to get unrestricted tunnels. https://dashboard.pinggy.io

http://rnlky-<EXAMPLE>.a.free.pinggy.link
https://rnlky-<EXAMPLE>.a.free.pinggy.link
```

Note the assigned public HTTPS URL, which will be used as the Key Filter Remote URL.

Keep the ssh tunnel running in a separate terminal for the duration of this tutorial.

### Test the Key Filter Server

Test the Key Filter Server by sending a POST request with the End-User Token as the body.

```shell copy="fl"
$ curl -X POST -d 'user1_token_example' https://<TUNNEL_URL>/keyfilter
```

## Create an Access Key

Create an Access Key to authenticate the WebSocket connection. This key will only allow consumer access to the specified topic.

We specify `user_token` as the query parameter that the WebSocket Gateway will expect and pass to the Key Filter Server to fetch the Key Filter.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud access-key create my-access-key-1 --topic multi-user-demo --consume --key-filter-remote user_token:https://<TUNNEL_URL>/keyfilter
```

## Consuming records as an End User

### Install websocat

Install the `websocat` command line tool to consume records from the WebSocket Gateway.

Follow the instructions from the [websocat GitHub repository] for your operating system.

You may also install from source using Cargo.
```shell copy="fl"
$ cargo install websocat
```

### Consume records using the WebSocket Gateway

Consume records from the topic using the WebSocket Gateway. The Access Key is passed as a query parameter in the URL. The Access Key determines which topic will be read from.

Typically we would consume records using the WebSocket Gateway consume endpoint. Specify `head=0` query param to start consuming from the beginning of the topic.

```shell copy="fl"
$ websocat "wss://infinyon.cloud/wsr/v1/simple/consume?access_key=<ACCESS_KEY>&head=0"
```

This will not work since the Access Key is configured with the Key Kilter Remote option. We need to pass the `user_token` query parameter to the consume endpoint.

Since we specified `--key-filter-remote user_token:https://rnlky-example.a.free.pinggy.link/keyfilter`, we need to pass the `user_token` query parameter to the consume endpoint.

The following shows the connecting to the WebSocket Gateway consume endpoint with the `user_token` query parameter set for User1's token `user1_token_example`.

```shell copy="fl"
$ websocat "wss://infinyon.cloud/wsr/v1/simple/consume?access_key=<ACCESS_KEY>&head=0&user_token=user1_token_example"
Message for User1
```

Note that only the record with the key `user1` is returned, effectively enforcing that User1 is only seeing records intended for User1.

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to authenticate end users using the WebSocket Gateway. By using a Key Filter Server, you can restrict access to records based on the end user's identity. This allows you to build multi-user or multi-tenant applications targeting Infinyon Cloud.
