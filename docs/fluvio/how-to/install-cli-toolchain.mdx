title: "Install Fluvio CLI Toolchain"
description: "A short tutorial for using fvm"
---

This is a short introduction to FVM, the Fluvio Version Manager, which allows you to use multiple versions of the Fluvio CLI toolchain.

The FVM CLI is the official package manager for Fluvio, managing various `fluvio` binaries and development tools -- enabling the selection from multiple versions or release channels.

## Install FVM

The following command will install `fvm` and `fluvio` and other binaries in the development kit.

```shell copy="fl"
$ curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash
```

The installation script prints a command that adds the the Fluvio binaries to your shell PATH environment variable. This is required to follow the following steps.

On macOS, run this command and then close and reopen your terminal.

```shell copy="fl"
$ echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.fvm/bin:${HOME}/.fluvio/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### What version are you running?

Running `fvm current` should display the most recent version of `fluvio` toolchain installed.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fvm current
x.y.z (stable)
```

## Release channels

Also in the output of `fvm current` we see `stable`, which is the name of the default release channel, and the active channel in use. There are 2 channels: `stable`, `latest`.

Installing channels with `fvm install` will also make that channel active.


### The Active channel

Only one channel is active at a time. You can use [`fvm switch`](#switching-between-channels) to select one of your installed channels.

FVM updates the `fluvio`/`smdk`/`cdk` etc. binaries used with the active channel's binaries.


### Stable release channel

The `stable` channel is installed by default. It is the most recent supported release.

The following commands are equivalent for installing or updating the `stable` release channel.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fvm install
$ fvm install stable
```


### Latest release channel

If you contact us for support in GitHub or Discord, we may request you to validate fixes from the `latest` channel.

This channel consists of most recent updates that have not yet been released, which may include experimental features or unexpected behavior.

The `latest` channel is not intended for typical usage.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fvm install latest
info: Downloading (1/5): fluvio@x.y.z-dev-1+bf4e86674ce546d6b853adbf36a97e8e3344bd17
info: Downloading (2/5): fluvio-run@x.y.z-dev-1+bf4e86674ce546d6b853adbf36a97e8e3344bd17
info: Downloading (3/5): fluvio-cloud@x.y.z
info: Downloading (4/5): smdk@x.y.z-dev-1+bf4e86674ce546d6b853adbf36a97e8e3344bd17
info: Downloading (5/5): cdk@x.y.z-dev-1+bf4e86674ce546d6b853adbf36a97e8e3344bd17
done: Installed fluvio version latest
done: Now using fluvio version x.y.z-dev-1+bf4e86674ce546d6b853adbf36a97e8e3344bd17
```

### Install a specific version

Specific releases can also be installed when you provide the version.

```shell
$ fvm install x.y.z
info: Downloading (1/5): fluvio@x.y.z
info: Downloading (2/5): fluvio-run@x.y.z
info: Downloading (3/5): fluvio-cloud@x.y.z
info: Downloading (4/5): smdk@x.y.z
info: Downloading (5/5): cdk@x.y.z
done: Installed fluvio version x.y.z
done: Now using fluvio version x.y.z
```

### Listing installed channels

The `fvm show` command will list out the installed channels and their corresponding version. The row with the checkmark (`✓`) is the current active channel.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fvm show
    CHANNEL  VERSION
 ✓  x.y.z  x.y.z
    stable   x.y.z
    latest   x.y.z-dev-1+bf4e86674ce546d6b853adbf36a97e8e3344bd17
```

## Switching between channels

If you are on another channel, you can change between them by running `fvm switch` with the name of the channel.

For typical usage of InfinyOn Cloud, we suggest using `stable`.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fvm switch stable

done: Now using Fluvio version stable
```

And we verify with `fvm show` that we are now back on the `stable` release channel.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fvm show
    CHANNEL  VERSION
 ✓  stable   x.y.z
    latest   x.y.z-dev-1+bf4e86674ce546d6b853adbf36a97e8e3344bd17
    x.y.z  x.y.z
```

## Conclusion

This wraps up the fundamental usage of FVM. While this guide covers the basics, FVM has more under the hood to explore and adapt to your workflows, ensuring a frictionless experience as you delve into Fluvio's ecosystem.

However, our expectation is that a majority of users will find the `stable` channel adequately meets their needs, making the transition to other channels unnecessary. For developers actively contributing through issues or code, and our design partners, FVM serves as a bridge for closer and smoother collaboration.

Hopefully this is just the beginning of your journey with FVM. We're excited to see how it enhances your interactions with our platform.
