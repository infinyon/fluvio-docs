The InfinyOn Hub serves as a centralized repository for InfinyOn SmartConnectors, SmartModules, and other extensions. It facilitates the discovery and deployment of extensions to enhance the data streaming capabilities of Fluvio. The hub provides a platform for developers and data engineers to easily access pre-built solutions or share their own extensions.

## List

Listing SmartModules will display the SmartModules available to your cluster.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio hub sm list
  SMARTMODULE                              Visibility
  infinyon-labs/array-map-json@x.y.z       public

Listing Connectors will display the connector packages you can download locally.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio hub conn list

  infinyon/sql-sink@x.y.z            public
```


## Download

Downloading a SmartModule is done with respect to your cluster. SmartModules need to be downloaded before they are used in transformations.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio hub sm download infinyon/jolt@x.y.z
downloading infinyon/jolt@x.y.z to infinyon-jolt-x.y.z.ipkg
... downloading complete
... checking package
trying connection to fluvio router.infinyon.cloud:9003
... cluster smartmodule install complete
```

Running `fluvio hub conn download` will download the package containing source code of the Connector.

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio hub conn download infinyon/http-source@x.y.z
downloading infinyon/http-source@x.y.z to infinyon-http-source-x.y.z.ipkg
... downloading complete
```
