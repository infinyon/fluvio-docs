The InfinyOn Hub serves as a centralized repository for InfinyOn SmartConnectors, SmartModules, and other extensions. It facilitates the discovery and deployment of extensions to enhance the data streaming capabilities of Fluvio. The hub provides a platform for developers and data engineers to easily access pre-built solutions or share their own extensions.

## Download

Downloading a SmartModule is done with respect to your cluster. SmartModules need to be downloaded before they are used in transformations.

%copy first-line%
```shell
$ fluvio hub sm download infinyon/jolt@0.3.0
downloading infinyon/jolt@0.3.0 to infinyon-jolt-0.3.0.ipkg
... downloading complete
... checking package
trying connection to fluvio router.infinyon.cloud:9003
... cluster smartmodule install complete
```

Running `fluvio hub conn download` will download the package containing source code of the Connector.

%copy first-line%
```shell
$ fluvio hub conn download infinyon/http-source@0.2.5
downloading infinyon/http-source@0.2.5 to infinyon-http-source-0.2.5.ipkg
