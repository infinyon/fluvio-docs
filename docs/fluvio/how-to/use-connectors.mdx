Ensure `fluvio` is installed and logged in to InfinyOn Cloud before proceeding. If not set up, follow the [Quick Start](/).

Connectors serve to transmit data into or out of your cluster, configurable via a YAML file.

Utilizing [InfinyOn Cloud] for managing connectors centralizes your data pipelines, both locally and on the cloud.

Manage your connectors efficiently with the [`fluvio cloud connector`][cli-connector] CLI.

## Create Your First Connector on InfinyOn Cloud

This guide demonstrates creating an Inbound HTTP connector to ingest JSON data from an HTTP endpoint.

Sign up for [InfinyOn Cloud] and log into the CLI to begin:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud login
```

### Example HTTP connector

Below is the configuration for the [Inbound HTTP connector]


```yaml
apiVersion: 0.1.0
meta:
  version: 0.2.1
  name: cat-facts
  type: http-source
  topic: cat-facts
  create-topic: true
http:
  endpoint: "https://catfact.ninja/fact"
  interval: 10s
```

In this configuration, a connector named `cat-facts` is created. It requests data from [a cat fact API](https://catfact.ninja) every 30 seconds and receives JSON data, which is stored in a topic named `cat-facts-data`.

#### Start a connector

Create a connector using the following command:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector create --config catfacts-basic-connector.yml
connector "cat-facts" (http-source) created
```

#### List all connectors

Once created, list the connectors and view their current status:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector list
 NAME       TYPE         VERSION  CDK  STATUS
 cat-facts  http-source  0.1.0    V3   Running
```

#### View connector logs

Debug connector behavior by accessing the logs:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector logs cat-facts
connector-startup infinyon/http-source@0.1.0

```

#### View data in topic

The HTTP connector should now be storing data in the specified topic:

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio topic list
  NAME            TYPE      PARTITIONS  REPLICAS  RETENTION TIME  COMPRESSION  STATUS                   REASON
  cat-facts-data  computed  1           1         7days           any          resolution::provisioned
```

Verify by consuming from the topic:

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume cat-facts-data -B
{"fact":"Female felines are \\superfecund","length":31}
{"fact":"Cats only sweat through their paws and nowhere else on their body","length":65}
{"fact":"While many parts of Europe and North America consider the black cat a sign of bad luck, in Britain and Australia, black cats are considered lucky.","length":146}
^C
```

<Idea>
The `--disable-continuous` flag exits the stream after displaying the last record.
</Idea>

#### Delete a connector

To stop the connector, delete it:

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector delete cat-facts
connector "cat-facts" deleted
```

This action wonâ€™t delete the topic. Delete it separately if needed:

```shell copy="fl"
$ fluvio topic delete cat-facts
topic "cat-facts" deleted
```

### Conclusion

You've created an Inbound HTTP connector, accessed the logs, viewed the HTTP response data in the Fluvio topic, and deleted the connector and topic post-exploration. You are now prepared to create your own connectors. Check the documentation for our supported Inbound and Outbound connectors to get started with your own data sources.
