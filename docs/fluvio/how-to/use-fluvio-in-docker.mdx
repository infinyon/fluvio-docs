# Use Fluvio in Docker

# Docker Compose + Fluvio

You can run Fluvio Clusters in a Docker Compose setup, for a local Proof of Concept or
development.

To run a Fluvio Cluster through Docker, you will need to run Fluvio
components separately, we can use Docker Compose `service`s to achieve this.

## Services

- `sc`: Streaming Controller
- `sc-setup`: Post-Initialization Commands
- `spu`: Streaming Processing Unit

> To learn more about Fluvio architecture, please refer to [Fluvio Documentation][1]

## Running Locally

Copy the docker-compose.yaml and Dockerfile to a directory.

> Or clone the Fluvio repo `git clone https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio.git` and
cd into `./fluvio/examples/docker-compose`

`docker-compose.yaml`:



```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  sc:
    image: infinyon/fluvio:stable
    container_name: sc
    hostname: sc
    ports:
      - "9103:9003"
    environment:
      - RUST_LOG=info
    command: "./fluvio-run sc --local /fluvio/metadata"
    volumes:
      - ./fluvio-metadata:/fluvio/metadata
  sc-setup:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: sc-setup
    environment:
      - RUST_LOG=info
    entrypoint: >
      /bin/sh -c "
      fluvio profile add docker sc:9003 docker;
      fluvio cluster spu register --id 5001 -p 0.0.0.0:9110 --private-server spu:9011;
      exit 0;
      "
    depends_on:
      - sc
  spu:
    image: infinyon/fluvio:stable
    container_name: spu
    hostname: spu
    volumes:
      - ./fluvio-data:/fluvio/data
    environment:
      - RUST_LOG=info
    ports:
      - "9110:9010"
      - "9111:9011"
    command: "./fluvio-run spu -i 5001 -p spu:9010 -v spu:9011 --sc-addr sc:9004 --log-base-dir /fluvio/data"
    depends_on:
      - sc

```

`Dockerfile`:



```
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl unzip
RUN curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh?ctx=dc | bash

ENV PATH "$PATH:/root/.fluvio/bin"
ENV PATH "$PATH:/root/.fvm/bin"
```

Run `docker compose up`.

> Optionally you can run on detached mode `docker compose up -d` so
> Fluvio runs in the background.

Then use the `fluvio` CLI to connect to the cluster running in Docker, to do
that you must set the _Fluvio Profile_ to point to Docker's container SC:

> If you dont have the Fluvio CLI installed on your local machine, run the following command
> `curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash`.
> Refer to [Fluvio CLI Reference][2] for more details.

```bash
fluvio profile add docker 127.0.0.1:9103 docker
```

> Fluvio Streaming Controller (SC) usually runs on port `9003` but given that our
> SC is running in a Docker Container, internal port `9003` is mapped to `9103`
> in your system's network.

With the profile set, you are now able to perform Fluvio Client operations
like listing topics:

```bash
fluvio topics list
```

## Teardown

In order to shutdown the Fluvio Cluster running in Docker, you must issue the
following `compose` command:

```bash
docker compose down
```

> Remember to run this command in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`
> file.
