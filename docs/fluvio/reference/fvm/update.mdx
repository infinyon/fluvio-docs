`fvm` takes care of updating Fluvio to the latest version.

If you are using a channel (e.g. `stable`, `latest`), you can update to the
latest version of that channel by running:

```shell
fvm update
```

For specific versions that are not tracked by a channel the `fvm update` command
will not have any effect. You will need to install the version you want to update.

For instance, if you are using Fluvio version `0.11.1` and you want to update to
`0.11.2`, you will need to install `0.11.2` using `fvm install`.

You can read more about installing different versions of Fluvio in the [channels section][channels].
