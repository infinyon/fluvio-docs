Fluvio is an open-source data streaming platform that aggregates, correlates, and apply programmable intelligence to data in motion.

Written in Rust, Fluvio provides low-latency, high-performance programmable streaming on cloud-native architecture.

SmartModules, powered by WebAssembly, provide users the ability to perform inline computations on streaming
data without leaving the cluster. - [Learn more about SmartModules][smartmodules]

Fluvio provides client libraries for several popular programming languages. â€“ [Learn more about Fluvio's client libraries][api]
