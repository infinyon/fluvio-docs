Fluvio is installed using _Fluvio Version Manager_, `fvm`, which allows you to use multiple versions of the Fluvio CLI toolchain.

The `fvm` CLI is the official package manager for Fluvio, managing various
`fluvio` binaries and development tools, enabling the selection from multiple
versions or release channels.

To install FVM, run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash
```

`fvm` will be installed at `~/.fvm/bin`, and will install fluvio and the rest
of the development tools at `~/.fluvio/bin`.

You will need to add these directories to your shellâ€™s PATH environment
variable.

By default, the `stable` channel is installed along with `fvm`. You can learn
more about channels in the [Install](/docs/fluvio/fvm/cli/install) section.
