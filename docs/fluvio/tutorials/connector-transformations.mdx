# Connector Transformations

This tutorial is part of the **HTTP website to SQL database** series:
* [Part 1: HTTP Source -> Topic]
* **Part 2: Connector Transformations**
* [Part 3: Topic -> SQL Sink]


## Introduction

Building on the [HTTP Source -> Topic] tutorial, we will customize the Source HTTP Connector with transformations to modify the records before sending them to the topic.

#### Why would you want to do this? 

Often, you are only interested in a subset of the data, or add/remove fields, or even change the shape of the record. This is where transformations come in.

#### Prerequisites

You will need a `local` fluvio cluster and `cdk` to follow along. Follow the [installation instructions][installation] if you don't have them already.


## SmartModules

SmartModules are reusable pieces of code that can be attached to a connector to perform specific tasks. In this case, we will use a SmartModule to transform the incoming JSON records before we send it to the topic.

SmartModules are executed using the WebAssembly runtime, which means they are small and secure. You can write your own SmartModule in Rust, or use the prepackaged ones from the [SmartModule Hub].

Unlike connectors, SmartModules in the Hub are packaged WASM files. 

The SmartModule we will use in this tutorial implements domain specific language (DSL) called [Jolt], to specify a transformation of input JSON to another shape of JSON data.

To use jolt SmartModule, we need to download it to the cluster.


import HubSmDownload from '!!raw-loader!@site/embeds/cmds/hub-sm-download-jolt.bash';

<CodeBlock language="bash" copyBehavior="fl">$ {HubSmDownload}</CodeBlock>



Once you have the SmartModule downloaded, you can list them:

import HubSmList from '!!raw-loader!@site/embeds/cmds/sm-list-jolt.bash';

<CodeBlock language="bash" copyBehavior="fl">$ {HubSmList}</CodeBlock>


## Customizing HTTP Connector with JOLT SmartModule

In order to customize the HTTP Source Connector, we need to create a configuration file that includes the transformation.

Before we start modified connector, please terminate existing running connector.

Coyp and paste following config and save it as `http-cat-facts-transform.yaml`.   This configuration use the same endpoint as the previous tutorial except different topic name.


import CatFactBasic from '!!raw-loader!@site/embeds/connectors/http-cat-fact-transform.yaml';

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{CatFactBasic}</CodeBlock>


Noticed that we just added `transforms` section which added JOLT specification to insert a new field `source` with value `http` to every record.

Once you have the config file, you can create the connector using the `cdk deploy start` command as before.  


import CdkDeployHttpSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/embeds/cmds/cdk-deploy-start-http-source-cat-facts-xform.bash';

<CodeBlock language="bash" copyBehavior="fl">$ {CdkDeployHttpSrc}</CodeBlock>


You can use `cdk deploy list` to view the status of the connector.

```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy list
 NAME       STATUS  
 cat-facts  Running 
```

## Check the data

Similar to the previous tutorial, we can use `fluvio consume` to view the incoming data in the topic `cat-facts-transformed` which was created by the connector.

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume cat-facts -T4
Consuming records starting 4 from the end of topic 'cat-facts'

{"fact":"Heat occurs several times a year and can last anywhere from 3 to 15 days.","length":73,"source":"http"}
{"fact":"Cats prefer to remain non-confrontational. They will not fight to show dominance, but rather to stake their territory. Cats will actually go to extremes to avoid one another in order to prevent a possible confrontation.","length":219,"source":"http"}
{"fact":"Cats only sweat through their paws and nowhere else on their body","length":65,"source":"http"}
{"fact":"Unlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth. Scientists believe this is due to a mutation in a key taste receptor.","length":114,"source":"http"}
```
As you can see, the `source` field has been added to every record. This is the transformation we added to the connector.

You can terminate the consume command by pressing `Ctrl+C`.


## Clean up

Shut down the connector and delete the topic.

```bash copy="full"
$ cdk deploy shutdown --name cat-facts-transformed
$ fluvio topic delete cat-facts-transform
```


## Conclusion and Next Step

In this tutorial, we showed you how to customize the HTTP Source Connector with transformation using SmartModule.  

SmartModule is a powerful tool that can be used to perform complex transformations on the incoming data.  

In the next tutorial, we will show you how to use the sink connector to stream data from an topic to a SQL database.
