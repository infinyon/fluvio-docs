# Mirroring IoT Data from Raspberry Pi

This advanced tutorial requires a Raspberry Pi and a local installation of your collector cluster running on Local.

## Raspberry Pi to Local Cluster

This section will use a Raspberry Pi v3 running Ubuntu as the remote device and our local machine for the home cluster.

Let's start with installing and configuring the home cluster.


### Download `fluvio` binary

Use `curl` to download and install:


```bash
curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash
```

Make sure to add `.fluvio/bin` to the `$PATH`as specified in the installation script.


### Start home cluster

Use the fluvio binary to start the cluster:


```bash
fluvio cluster start
```

Check the result with:


```bash
fluvio cluster status
```



**Remote Raspberry Cluster**:


```bash
fluvio remote register remote-raspberry
```

### Create the mirror topic

Mirror topics on the home cluster have multiple partitions, where each partition has a `1-to-1` relationship with the remote cluster.

Create the mirror topic, then add the remote to it:

```bash
fluvio topic create mirror-topic  --mirror
fluvio topic add-mirror mirror-topic remote-raspberry
```

or apply a JSON file with an array of remotes that you want to assign when creating a topic:

```bash
echo '["remote-raspberry"]' > assignment_file.json
fluvio topic create mirror-topic --mirror-apply assignment_file.json
```

List partitions to check the assignment:


```bash
fluvio partition list
```

It should display all partitions:

```bash
  TOPIC         PARTITION  LEADER  MIRROR                     REPLICAS  RESOLUTION  SIZE  HW  LEO  LRS  FOLLOWER OFFSETS
  mirror-topic  0          5001    remote-raspberry           []        Online      0 B   0   0    0    0                 []
```

List remote clusters to check their status:


```bash
fluvio remote list
```

It should show the following:

```bash
  REMOTE              SC STATUS  SPU STATUS  LAST SEEN  ERRORS
  remote-raspberry    Waiting    Waiting     -          -
```

### Generate Metadata for a Remote Cluster

Each remote cluster requires a unique metadata file that gives the remote cluster the information to connect to the home cluster and the topic/mirror where the data is synchronized.

The home remote device is a Raspberry Pi device. You may skip this if you don't have such a device.

:::tip
  The IP address of our machine where the home server is running is `192.168.1.42`.  Please identify your own IP address and replace it with the command below.
:::


```bash
fluvio remote export remote-raspberry --public-endpoint 192.168.1.42 --file remote2.json
```

We'll transfer these files to remote devices in the following sections.

# Install Remote Cluster on Raspberry Pi

We'll use the same procedure as before to mirror from the Raspberry Pi to the same home cluster.
The test below was performed on a Raspberry Pi v3 running an Ubuntu image.

### Download the metadata file

We'll use the metadata file `remote-raspberry.json` that we've exported above to provision this device.

:::tip
  Identify the IP address of your Raspberry Pi device and it replaces below
:::

Using the `home` terminal, let's use the `scp` command to send the `remote-raspberry.json` file to the remote device:


```bash
scp remote-raspberry.json fluvio@192.168.1.50:~
```

### Login to the remote device

Spawn a new terminal and login into the Raspberry Pi:


```bash
ssh fluvio@192.168.1.50
```

### Download fluvio binaries

On the Raspberry Pi, run the following command:


```bash
curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash
```

Run `fluvio version` to double-check.

### Start cluster

First we will start the cluster:


```bash
fluvio cluster start
```


Then, we'll use the metadata file on the Raspberry Pi to connect:

```bash
fluvio home connect --file remote-raspberry.json
```

Let's check the partitions:


```bash
fluvio partition list
```

The remote device should show the following partition::

```bash
  TOPIC       PARTITION  LEADER  MIRROR                         REPLICAS  RESOLUTION  SIZE  HW  LEO  LRS  FOLLOWER OFFSETS
  mirror-topic  0          5001    home_name:0:public_endpoint    []        Online      0 B   11  11   11   0                 []
```

## Test 1:  Mirror from Raspberry Pi Remote to Home

Let's produce on the Raspberry Pi and consume from the home cluster.

### Produce for a remote cluster

Produce on the `pi` terminal:


```bash
fluvio produce mirror-topic
```

```bash
> A
Ok!
> B
Ok!
```

### Consume from home

Consume on the `home` terminal:

```bash
fluvio consume mirror-topic --mirror remote-raspberry -B
```

```bash
A
B
```

Mirror test is successful.



## Test 2:  Home Cluster Offline

Shutdown the home cluster and check that the remote cluster can continue receiving records. Then, resume the home cluster and ensure the data is synchronized and can be consumed on both sides.

### Shutdown the home cluster

On the `home` terminal, shutdown the cluster:


```bash
fluvio cluster shutdown --local
```

Ensure the cluster is off with:


```bash
 fluvio cluster status
```

### Produce on the remote cluster

Produce a few more records on the `pi` terminal:

```bash
fluvio produce mirror-topic
```

```
C
D
E
```

### Reconnect home cluster & consume from topic

On the `home` terminal, restart the cluster:


```bash
fluvio cluster upgrade --local
```

The topic on the home cluster should automatically synchronize with the remote cluster.

:::tip
  Wait for the connection retry interval to trigger for the records to arrive.
:::

Let's consume:


```bash
fluvio consume mirror-topic --mirror remote-raspberry -B
```

```
A
B
C
D
E
```

The disconnect test was successful.



## Test 3: Remote Cluster Offline

This test ensures that the remote cluster will not lose data following a power loss.

### Restart the remote cluster

On the `remote` terminal, shutdown the cluster:


```bash
fluvio cluster shutdown --local
```

Restart the cluster:


```bash
fluvio cluster upgrade
```

### Consume from a remote cluster

First, on the `pi` terminal, check the status of the target cluster:

```bash
fluvio cluster home
```
```bash
HOME  ROUTE            STATUS  SC STATUS  SPU STATUS  LAST SEEN  ERRORS
home  localhost:30003  Online  Connected  Connected   1s         -
```

Then, consume from the remote cluster:


```bash
fluvio consume mirror-topic -B
```

```
A
B
C
D
E
```

Produce records and observe that the mirror will resume the synchronization.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You have successfully tested remote mirroring using the Raspberry Pi. It is now time to roll it out in your environment.
