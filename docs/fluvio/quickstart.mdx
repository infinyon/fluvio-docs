# Quickstart

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Fluvio and then
will introduce you to the basic concepts of Fluvio.

## Install Fluvio

Fluvio is installed via the **Fluvio Version Manager**, also known as `fvm`.

To install `fvm`, run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash
```

As part of the initial setup, `fvm` will also install the Fluvio CLI
available in the **stable** channel as of the moment of installation.

Fluvio is stored in `$HOME/.fluvio`, with the executable binaries stored in
`$HOME/.fluvio/bin`.

Example:

```bash
$ curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash

☁️  Downloading fluvio version manager, fvm

```

## Create your first Fluvio cluster

Create a free [InfinyOn Cloud][inf-cloud] account to get access to InfinyOn Hub. The Hub is a data streaming store for pre-built connectors, smartmodules and other workflow components.

Your InfinyOn Cloud account has free credits, which you may use to run Fluvio clusters in the cloud.

Head over to the [InfinyOn Cloud sign-up page][inf-cloud-sign-up] and create an account. Depending on which method you choose in account creation, you can log in with OAuth2 or username/password.

**Login to InfinyOn Cloud using OAuth**

```bash
$ fluvio cloud login --use-oauth2
A web browser has been opened at https://infinyon-cloud.us.auth0.com/activate?user_code=GLMC-QDDJ.
Please proceed with authentication.
```

**Login with your Username/Password**

```bash
$ fluvio cloud login
InfinyOn Cloud email: john@example.com
Password:
```

### Start a Cluster

Start cluster on InfinyOn Cloud:

```bash
$ fluvio cloud cluster create
```

### Create your first topic

Topics are used to store data and send data streams.

You can create a topic with the following command:

```bash
$ fluvio topic create quickstart-topic
```

> Where `quickstart-topic` is the name of your topic

### Produce Records

You can send data (aka _produce_) to your topic.

Let’s try to produce text to your topic interactively:

```bash
$ fluvio produce quickstart-topic
> hello world!
Ok!
```

Typing anything and then pressing Enter will send a record to your topic.

> Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the interactive producer prompt.

### Consume Records

You can read data (aka _consume_) from your topic.

This command will create a consumer that listens to your topic for new records and then prints it to the screen:

```bash
$ fluvio consume quickstart-topic
Consuming records from the end of topic 'quickstart-topic'. This will wait for new records
```

To see this in action, open another terminal and produce new data.

To see previously sent data, you can add an option to your consume command to request a starting offset with the `-B <offset>` flag.

```bash
$ fluvio consume quickstart-topic -B -d
hello world!
```

**Flags**:
- `-B` flag is used to specify the starting offset. Defaults to `0`
- `-d` closes the consumer connection after all data has been sent.

### Integrate with Connectors

InfinyOn offers a growing number of connectors to communicate with external services. In this example, we will be covering the HTTP Source connector. The connector polls data from an HTTP endpoint that returns a random quote every 3 seconds to a topic called quotes.

Save the following configuration file on your machine:

```yaml title="quotes-source-connector.yml"
apiVersion: 0.1.0
meta:
  version: 0.2.5
  name: http-quotes
  type: http-source
  topic: quotes
http:
  endpoint: https://demo-data.infinyon.com/api/quote
  interval: 3s
```

### Running the HTTP Connector

To start a connector in InfinyOn Cloud, use the following command:

```bash
$ fluvio cloud connector create -c quotes-source-connector.yml
```

Use the following command to see the connector status.

```bash
$ fluvio cloud connector list
 NAME                 TYPE               VERSION  CDK  STATUS   LOG-LEVEL
 http-quotes          http-source        0.2.6    V3   Running  info
```

We can monitor new data in the connector’s topic with fluvio consume quotes

```bash
$ fluvio consume quotes
Consuming records from 'quotes'
{"quote":"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.","by":"Albert Einstein"}
{"quote":"Whatever you are, be a good one.","by":"Abraham Lincoln"}
{"quote":"You can't build a reputation on what you're going to do.","by":"Henry Ford"}
{"quote":"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.","by":"Winston Churchill"}
```

You may delete your cloud connector with the following command:

```bash
fluvio cloud connector delete http-quotes
```

### Transform Data with SmartModules

SmartModules are user-defined functions compiled into WebAssembly and applied to data streaming for inline data manipulation. You can use SmartModules in the producers, consumers, as well as Connectors. InfinyOn has several pre-compiled SmartModules that you can use out of the box. Alternatively, you use SmartModule Developer Kit (smdk) to build your own.

### Download a SmartModule from the Hub

InfinyOn Hub has a growing library of SmartModules available for download:

```bash
$ fluvio hub smartmodule list
  SMARTMODULE                              Visibility
  infinyon-labs/array-map-json@0.1.0       public
  infinyon-labs/dedup-filter@0.0.2         public
  infinyon-labs/json-formatter@0.1.0       public
  infinyon-labs/key-gen-json@0.1.0         public
  infinyon-labs/regex-map-json@0.1.1       public
  infinyon-labs/regex-map@0.1.0            public
  infinyon-labs/rss-json@0.1.0             public
  infinyon-labs/stars-forks-changes@0.1.2  public
  infinyon/jolt@0.3.0                      public
  infinyon/json-sql@0.2.1                  public
  infinyon/regex-filter@0.1.0              public
```

### Using the `jolt` SmartModule to turn JSON records into sentences

Let’s download the Smartmodule to our cluster:

```bash
$ fluvio hub smartmodule download infinyon/jolt@0.3.0
... cluster smartmodule install complete
```

Check the cluster to ensure it has been successfully downloaded:

```bash
$  fluvio smartmodule list
  SMARTMODULE          SIZE
  infinyon/jolt@0.3.0  611.5 KB
```

Next, we’ll create a transform file and test the output.

#### Create a SmartModule transformation file

SmartModules can be chained together and often require additional parameters. Fluvio uses a YAML file is used to define the transformations.

```yaml title="transforms.yml"
transforms:
  - uses: infinyon/jolt@0.3.0
    with:
      spec:
        - operation: shift
          spec:
            quote: ""
```

Jolt is a complex Smartmodule that allows you to perform multiple types of JSON transformations. For additional information, check out the SmartModule Jolt docs.

#### Test the SmartModule

```bash
$  fluvio consume quotes --transforms-file tranforms.yaml -T=2
Consuming records from 'quotes' starting 2 from the end of log
"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
```

We are consuming the last two quotes topic records and transforming the json into a string.

### Creating a data pipeline applying the SmartModule to the Connector

Let’s say we don’t use the authors in the quotes; instead, only the quote represented strings. We can accomplish this result by simply applying the transformation to the connector.

Let’s create a new http-source connector and add the transformation:

```yaml title="string-quotes-source-connector.yml"
apiVersion: 0.1.0
meta:
  version: 0.2.5
  name: string-quotes
  type: http-source
  topic: string-quotes
http:
  endpoint: https://demo-data.infinyon.com/api/quote
  interval: 3s
transforms:
  - uses: infinyon/jolt@0.3.0
    with:
      spec:
        - operation: shift
          spec:
            quote: ""
```

Ready to run the connector:

```bash
$ fluvio cloud connector create -c string-quotes-source-connector.yml
```

Use the following command to see the connector status.

```bash
$ fluvio cloud connector list
 NAME                 TYPE               VERSION  CDK  STATUS   LOG-LEVEL
 string-quotes        http-source        0.2.5    V3   Running  info
 http-quotes          http-source        0.2.5    V3   Running  info
```

Let’s take a look at string-quotes

```bash
$ fluvio consume string-quotes
Consuming records from 'string-quotes'
"It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up."
"Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom."
```

We now have two topics running in parallel and producing different results with a simple SmartModule transformation. When you apply inline transformations, the number of possibilities is virtually endless.

### Clean-up Resources

During this tutorial, we’ve created connectors that continue generating traffic to our cloud cluster. Run the following commands to clean up:

```bash
fluvio cloud connector delete http-quotes
fluvio cloud connector delete string-quotes
fluvio topic delete quotes
fluvio topic delete string-quotes
```
