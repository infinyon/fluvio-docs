# Quickstart

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Fluvio and then
will introduce you to the basic concepts.

## Install Fluvio

Fluvio is installed via the **Fluvio Version Manager**, also known as `fvm`.

To install `fvm`, run the following command:

```bash copy="fl"
curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash

☁️  Downloading fluvio version manager, fvm
   target arch aarch64-apple-darwin
⬇️ Installing fvm
   ...
```

As part of the initial setup, `fvm` will also install the Fluvio CLI
available in the **stable** channel as of the moment of installation.

Fluvio is stored in `$HOME/.fluvio`, with the executable binaries stored in
`$HOME/.fluvio/bin`.

## Start a Cluster

Start cluster on you local machine with the following command:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cluster start
```

:::tip
  To run a cloud cluster, see the [Cloud] documentation.

## Create your first topic

Topics are used to store data and send data streams.

You can create a topic with the following command:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio topic create quickstart-topic
```

> Where `quickstart-topic` is the name of your topic

## Produce Records

You can send data (aka _produce_) to your topic.

Let’s try to produce text to your topic interactively:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio produce quickstart-topic
> hello world!
Ok!
```

Typing anything and then pressing Enter will send a record to your topic.

> Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the interactive producer prompt.

## Consume Records

You can read data (aka _consume_) from your topic.

This command will create a consumer that listens to your topic for new records and then prints it to the screen:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume quickstart-topic
Consuming records from the end of topic 'quickstart-topic'. This will wait for new records
```

Note, that `hello world!` was already sent to the topic, so you will not see it printed to the screen.

To see previously sent data, open a new terminal and add an option to your consume command to request a starting offset with the ` -B, --beginning <offset>` flag.

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume quickstart-topic -B -d
hello world!
```

**Flags**:
- `-B, --beginning` flag is used to specify the starting offset. Defaults to `0`
- `-d, --disable-continuous` closes the consumer connection after all data has been sent.

## Start a Connector

InfinyOn offers a growing number of connectors to communicate with external services. In this example, we will be covering the HTTP Source connector. The connector polls data from an HTTP endpoint that returns a random quote every 3 seconds to a topic called quotes.

Create a file and save the following configuration:

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{HttpSrcQuotes}</CodeBlock>


## Running the HTTP Connector

We'll use [Connector Developer Kit (cdk)] to download and run the connector.

<CodeBlock language="bash" copyBehavior="fl">$ {CdkHubDownload}</CodeBlock>

Run the following command to deploy the connector:

<CodeBlock language="bash" copyBehavior="fl">$ {CdkDeployHttpSrcQuotes}</CodeBlock>

Use the following command to see the connector status.

```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy list
 NAME         STATUS
 http-quotes  Running
```

We can monitor new data in the connector’s topic with fluvio consume quotes

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume quotes
Consuming records from 'quotes'
{"quote":"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.","by":"Albert Einstein"}
{"quote":"Whatever you are, be a good one.","by":"Abraham Lincoln"}
{"quote":"You can't build a reputation on what you're going to do.","by":"Henry Ford"}
{"quote":"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.","by":"Winston Churchill"}
```

## Transform Records with SmartModules

SmartModules are user-defined functions compiled into WebAssembly and applied to data streaming for inline data manipulation. You can use SmartModules in the producers, consumers, as well as Connectors. InfinyOn has several pre-compiled SmartModules that you can use out of the box. Alternatively, you can [build your own].

To list available smartmodules, run:

<CodeBlock language="bash" copyBehavior="fl">$ {FlvHubSmListJolt}</CodeBlock>


### Use `jolt` SmartModule to turn JSON records into sentences

Let’s download the Smartmodule to our cluster:

<CodeBlock language="bash" copyBehavior="fl">$ {FlvHubSmDownloadJolt}</CodeBlock>

Check the cluster to ensure it has been successfully downloaded:

<CodeBlock language="bash" copyBehavior="fl">$ {HubSmListJolt}</CodeBlock>


Next, we’ll create a transform file and test the output.

### Create a SmartModule transformation file

SmartModules can be chained together and often require additional parameters. Fluvio uses a YAML file is used to define the transformations.

Create a file named `transforms.yaml` and paste the following configuration:

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{TransformsJolt}</CodeBlock>

Jolt is a complex Smartmodule that allows you to perform multiple types of JSON transformations. For additional information, check out the SmartModule Jolt docs.

### Test the SmartModule

```bash copy="fl"
$  fluvio consume quotes --transforms-file transforms.yaml -T=2
Consuming records from 'quotes' starting 2 from the end of log
"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
```

We are consuming the last two quotes topic records and transforming the json into a string. The stream continues consuming as our connectors is still running.


## Create a data pipeline with a Connector and a SmartModule

Let’s say we don’t use the authors in the quotes; instead, only the quote represented strings. We can accomplish this result by simply applying the transformation to the connector.

Let’s create a new file add the following configuration:

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{HttpSrcQuotesTransform}</CodeBlock>

Ready to run the connector:

<CodeBlock language="bash" copyBehavior="fl">$ {CdkDeployHttpSrcStringQuotes}</CodeBlock>

Use the following command to see the connector status.

```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy list
 NAME           STATUS
 http-quotes    Running
 string-quotes  Running
```

Let’s take a look at string-quotes

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume string-quotes
Consuming records from 'string-quotes'
"It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up."
"Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom."
```

We now have two topics running in parallel and producing different results with a simple SmartModule transformation. When you apply inline transformations, the number of possibilities are virtually endless.

## Clean-up Resources

During this tutorial, we’ve created a couple connectors and three topics. Let's clean-up:

```bash
cdk deploy shutdown --name http-quotes
cdk deploy shutdown --name string-quotes
fluvio topic delete quotes
fluvio topic delete string-quotes
fluvio topic delete quickstart-topic
```

## Build complex data pipelines with Stateful Dataflows (sdf)

Stateful Dataflows, also known as SDF, allow you to build hierarchical data pipelines with enrichment, window processing, and more.
