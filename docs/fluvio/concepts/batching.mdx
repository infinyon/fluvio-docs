title: "Batching"

Fluvio producers try to send records in batches to reduce the number of messages sent and improve throughput. Each producer has some configurations that can be set to improve performance for a specific use case. For instance, they can be used to reduce disk usage, reduce latency, or improve throughput.
As of today, batching behavior in Fluvio Producers can be modified with the following configurations:

- `max_request_size`: Indicates the maximum amount of bytes that the producer can send in a single request. If the record is larger than the max request size, the producer will fail to send the record. Only the uncompressed size of the record is considered. Defaults to 1048576 bytes.
- `batch_size`: Indicates the maximum amount of bytes that can be accumulated in a batch. If the record is larger than the batch size, the producer will send the record in a single new batch. Only the uncompressed size of the record is considered. Defaults to 16384 bytes.
- `compression`: Compression algorithm used by the producer to compress each batch before sending it to the SPU. Supported compression algorithms are none, gzip, snappy and lz4.
- `linger`:  Time to wait before sending batches to the server that have not reached maximum batch size. Defaults to 100 ms.


# Trade-offs and Considerations

Each configuration offers a balance of benefits and trade-offs:

- `max_request_size`: Allows the producer to send larger records, but may increase the risk of network congestion and latency. 
- `batch_size`: Larger value can reduce the number of requests sent to the server, but may increase latency. Smaller value can reduce latency, but may increase the number of requests.
- `compression`: Helps reduce storage space at the cost of increased CPU usage for compressing and decompressing data. Larger batch_size values generally improve compression ratios, especially with larger payloads.
- `linger`: A value of 0 sends records immediately, minimizing latency but potentially reducing throughput. Higher values introduce some delay but can enhance throughput by enabling more efficient batching.

The ideal parameters for the `max_request_size`, `batch_size`, `linger` and `compression` depend on your application needs.

# Example Scenarios

Before testing, create a topic and generate a large data file:

```bash
fluvio topic create example-topic
printf 'This is a sample line. ' | awk -v b=500000 '{while(length($0) < b) $0 = $0 $0}1' | cut -c1-500000 > large-data-file.txt
```

### Max Request Size

`max_request_size` will define the maximum size of a message that can be sent by the producer. If a message exceeds this size, Fluvio will throw an error. Even if it's a message with only one record or a batch of them.

```bash
fluvio produce example-topic --max-request-size 16384 --file large-data-file.txt --raw
```

Will be displayed the following error:

```bash
the given record is larger than the max_request_size (16384 bytes).
```

### Batch Size

`batch_size` will define the maximum size of a batch of records that can be sent by the producer. If a record exceeds this size, Fluvio will process the record in a new batch without the `batch_size` as limit.

```bash
fluvio produce example-topic --batch-size 16536 --file large-data-file.txt --raw
```

There will not be any errors displayed, even if the message exceeds the batch size. But the record will be processed as a new batch.

### Compression

These parameters only uses the uncompressed size of the records, even with some compression algorithm is enabled.

`batch_size` and `max_request_size` will only use the uncompressed message size.

```bash
fluvio produce example-topic --batch-size 16536 --compression gzip --file large-data-file.txt --raw
fluvio produce example-topic --max-request-size 16384 --compression gzip --file large-data-file.txt --raw
```

Only the second command will display an error because the uncompressed message exceeds the max request size.


### Linger

`linger` will define the time that the producer will wait before sending a batch of records. If the batch is not full, the producer will wait for the linger time to send the batch.

Even with a high linger this command will send the batch immediately because the batch is full:

```bash
fluvio produce example-topic --linger 10sec --file large-data-file.txt --raw
```

With small records, the producer will wait for the linger time to send the batch:
  
```bash   
fluvio produce example-topic --linger 10sec
> abc
> abc
> abc
```

As all the records are small and the batch is not full, the producer will wait for the linger time to send the batch.
