title: "Partitions"

**Partitions** are the unit of parallelism accessed independently by **producers** and **consumers** within a **topic**.

Each record stored in a partition is
given an offset, starting from zero and monotonically increasing by one for each new
record.

Once a record is committed to a partition and an offset is assigned to it, the offset in that partition will _always_ refer to that record. Because of this, all records that are sent to a given partition are
guaranteed to remain ordered in the order they were committed.


**Partitions** are configuration objects managed by the system. Topics and partitions are linked through a **parent-child** relationship. The partition generation algorithm is described in the [SC Architecture].

If a topic is deleted, all associated partitions are automatically removed.

#### Producing with Multiple Partitions

When producing records to a Topic that has multiple partitions, there are two cases to
consider when determining the partitioning behavior. These cases are:

- When producing a record that **has a key**, and
- When producing a record that **has no key**

##### Key/value records

When producing records with keys, the producers will use _hash partitioning_,
where the partition number is derived from the hash of the record's key. This
is used to uphold the golden rule of key-based partitioning:

> **Records with the same key are always sent to the same partition**

The current implementation of key hashing uses the **sip-2-4** hashing algorithm,
but that is subject to change in the future.

##### Records with no keys

When producing records with no keys, producers will simply assign partition numbers
to incoming records in a round-robin fashion, spreading the load evenly across the
available partitions.

#### Consuming with Multiple Partitions

Currently, consumers are limited to reading from one partition at a time. This means
that in order to read all records from a given topic, it may be necessary to instantiate
one consumer per partition in the topic.

#### Add Partitions to a Topic

Even topics already created can have new partitions added to them, allowing more parallelism and higher throughput, but also using more disk space.

Adding a partition will not rebalance the data from the existing partitions. The rebalancing will happen naturally after the records age.
