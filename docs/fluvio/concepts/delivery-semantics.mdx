title: "Delivery Semantics"
---

The Internet, as well as other networks, is considered an unreliable communication channel. There can be delays or lost messages, and connections can fail unexpectedly.
This affects the reliability of record delivery between producers and the SPU.

Fluvio producers can be configued with a `delivery_semantic` configuration option, which allows choosing a delivery mechanism. Each mechanism has
a different trade-off between reliability and performance. There are two delivery semantics currently supported by producers:
`at-most-once` and `at-least-once` (default).


Regardless of `delivery_semantic`, Fluvio batches outgoing records so it is necessary to flush the producer once all records have been sent to ensure proper delivery.


```rust
let fluvio = Fluvio::connect().await?;
let config = TopicProducerConfigBuilder::default()
    .delivery_semantic(DeliverySemantic::AtMostOnce)
    .build()?;
let producer = fluvio.topic_producer_with_config("greetings", config).await?;
producer.send("Hello", "Fluvio!").await?;
producer.flush().await?;
```

The mechanism for accessing response metadata for produced records is also the same for both `at-most-once` and `at-least-once` delivery semantics.



```rust
let output = producer.send("Hello", "Fluvio!").await?;
// Provides response metadata for records such as offset.
// This only returns once batch has been sent and ack is received from SPU.
output.wait().await?;
```




### At Most Once
`at-most-once` delivery means that for each record generated by a producer, that record is delivered zero or one times. **This means that messages may be lost.**

The producer sends the message with records to the SPU and **does not
wait** for the response. This delivery method has higher throughput but no
guarantees that the message was delivered.


[Producer Isolation] has no effect if this delivery
semantic is used unless the user explicitly waits for the response, as shown in the following snippet:
<!-- TODO the content contained at this link is in contradiction with the content here -->


```rust
let fluvio = Fluvio::connect().await?;
let config = TopicProducerConfigBuilder::default()
    .delivery_semantic(DeliverySemantic::AtMostOnce)
    .build()?;
let producer = fluvio.topic_producer_with_config("greetings", config).await?;
let output = producer.send("Hello", "Fluvio!").await?;
output.wait().await?; // Producer isolation has no effect unless wait() is called
```


### At Least Once
`at-least-once` delivery means that for each record handed to the producer potentially **multiple attempts** are made
at delivering it, such that at least one succeeds. **This means that messages may be duplicated
but not lost.**

The producer sends the message with records to the SPU, **waits** for the response and **resends** in case of
transport errors occur. This delivery method has lower throughput comparing to `at-most-once` but better reliability.


[Producer Isolation] determines when the SPU will send the response signifying a successful delivery.


There are three main parameters that can be configured for `at-least-once` semantic: maximum amount of retries, the retry backoff strategy (fixed, Fibonacci, or exponential), and maximum timeout for all attempts.

Example:


```rust
let policy = RetryPolicy {
    max_retries: 5,
    initial_delay: Duration::from_millis(10),
    max_delay: Duration::from_sec(2),
    timeout: Duration::from_sec(10),
    strategy: RetryStrategy::ExponentialBackoff
};
let config = TopicProducerConfigBuilder::default()
    .delivery_semantic(DeliverySemantic::AtLeastOnce(policy))
    .build()?;
let producer = fluvio.topic_producer_with_config("greetings", config).await?;
```
In the above example, Fluvio Producer retries at most five times; all retries take a maximum of 10 seconds. The delay between retries increases exponentially.
The first delay is 10ms, the second is 100ms, then 1000ms, and all others are 2000ms as it's defined as a maximum allowed delay.
