Fluvio runs with many kubernetes installations. If you are comfortable with kubernetes already, install with your current context using the [`fluvio cluster`] command.

We have a more detailed tutorial to install and run with **Rancher Desktop Kubernetes** below, but we have fluvio users who use fluvio with:

- [minikube] (linux + others)
- [colima] (macos)
- [orbstack] (macos + linux)
- [AWS EKS]

If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our [Discord channel], our [Fluvio github repository]

## Install Rancher Desktop

:::note

First [install Fluvio] to go through this tutorial.

[install Fluvio]: fluvio/quickstart.mdx

:::



Navigate to the Rancher Desktop [installation page](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/) and follow the instructions. Rancher Desktop will provide access to other utilities needed to run Fluvio such as `kubectl` and `helm`.

Please make sure that the container runtime is `dockerd (moby)`. That configuration can be changed in the `Kubernetes Settings` section on the sidebar.

## Start Fluvio cluster

You can start a Fluvio cluster by running `fluvio cluster start`.

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cluster start --k8 --use-k8-port-forwarding
```

If rancher desktop is configured to manage a kubernetes cluster on a non-local host or ip, the `--proxy-addr` argument needs to provide that host dns name, or ip of that cluster.

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cluster start --k8 --proxy-addr HOSTNAME_OR_IP
```

### Verify cluster is running

We can check the fluvio cluster by checking version and status with the following command:

```bash
$ fluvio version
```

## Hello, Fluvio!

Congratulations, you've successfully installed Fluvio on your local machine!

Let's use the Fluvio CLI to play with some basic functionality.

The first thing we need to do is create a [topic].

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio topic create greetings
topic greetings created
```

Now that we have a topic, we can [produce] some messages!

Use the following command to send a message to the `greetings` topic:

```bash copy="fl"
$ echo Hello, Fluvio | fluvio produce greetings
```

Finally, we can [consume] messages back from the topic

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume greetings -B -d
Consuming records from the beginning of topic 'greetings'
Hello, Fluvio
```

Way to go! You're well on your way to writing real-time distributed apps with Fluvio!

If you run into any problems along the way, make sure to check out our [troubleshooting] page to find a fix.
