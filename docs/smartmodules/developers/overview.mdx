# Building Your Own SmartModule

Fluvio uses [SmartModules Development Kit (smdk)], and independent executable downloadable via [`fvm`] to help developers build and test SmartModules, and publish them to the SmartModule Hub.

Currently, SMDK is limited to the Rust programming language. However, you can be a Rust beginner and still take advantage of custom SmartModules.

##### Prerequisites

SMDK generator will prompt you to [`Install Rust`] on your system, add a Cargo target `wasm32-unknown-unknown` for compiling SmartModule Rust code into WebAssembly modules, and install [`cargo-generate`] for generating new Rust SmartModule projects.

### SMDK - Operations

SMDK helps developers build, test in-line, load to local or cloud Cluster, then publish to SmartModule Hub.

### Steps

1. [Generate a SmartModule]
2. [Build and Test]
3. [Load to your Cluster]
4. [Publish to SmartModule Hub]
