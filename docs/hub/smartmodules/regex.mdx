This is a [filter-type] SmartModule that tests the input record against a provided regular expression. The record is returned if there is a match.

### Usage example

To demonstrate how to use the [Regex] cerfied SmartModule with the [SMDK] tool. 

:::info
All smartmodule versions are marked with `x.y.z`. To find the latest version, run:
*  `fluvio hub smartmodule list`
:::

First, we need to download it to our cluster:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio hub download infinyon/regex-filter@x.y.z
```

Second, we create a file `transform.yaml` defining our regular expression:

```bash
# transform.yaml
transforms:
- uses: infinyon/regex-filter@x.y.z
  with:
    regex: "[Cc]at" 
```

Let's use `smdk test` to see it in action:


```bash copy="fl"
$ smdk test --text '{"fact": "Cats have supersonic hearing"}' --transforms-file ./transform.yaml
{"fact": "Cats have supersonic hearing"}
```

```bash copy="fl"
$ smdk test --text '{"fact": "Dogs have sweat glands at the bottom of their paws"}' --transforms-file ./transform.yaml
[No output returned]
```
