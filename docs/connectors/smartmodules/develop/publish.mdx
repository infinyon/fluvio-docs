SMDK publish give developers the ability to publish their own SmartModules to the [Hub].

This section assumes that `my-filter` project has been [built].

### Publish - Operation

From your `my-filter` directory and use the `publish` command:

```bash copy="fl"
$ smdk publish

Creating package john/my-filter@0.1.0
.. fill out info in hub/package-meta.yaml
Package hub/my-filter-0.1.0.ipkg created
Package uploaded!
```

#### Inspect Result

Ensure that your SmartModule has been uploaded to the [Hub]:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio hub smartmodule list

  SMARTMODULE                 Visibility
  john/my-filter@0.1.0        private
  ...
```

The SmartMoudule is now available for [download] by anyone with access to the `[Hub]`.

Congratulations :tada:!  You are now ready to build, test, and publish your own SmartModules.
