# Run Connectors on Your Local Machine

Check [the Hub] for a library of certified connectors that you can download and run. If the connector you need isn't available, you can [build your own]. This document will guide you through downloading and running a certified connector from the Hub on your local machine.


## 1. Download `http-source` Connector from the Hub

Let's create new directory and download <code>infinyon/http-source@{Versions.http_source}</code> connector from the Hub:

```bash copy="fl"
$ mkdir http-source; cd http-source
```

Use [`cdk`] to download the `http-source` connector:

```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk hub download infinyon/http-source@0.3.8
```

The file has been downloaded to your local machine.


## 2. Create a Connector Configuration File

Save the following configuration file on your machine:

```yaml
# quotes-connector.yml
apiVersion: 0.1.0
meta:
  version: 0.3.8
  name: http-quotes
  type: http-source
  topic: quotes
http:
  endpoint: https://demo-data.infinyon.com/api/quote
  interval: 2s
```

The configuration file ask the `http-source` connector to read a new quote `quote` from the `demo-data` server every 2 seconds.

## 3. Run the `http-source` Connector

Use connector `.ipkg` package file and the configuration file to run the connector:

```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy start --ipkg infinyon-http-source-0.3.8.ipkg --config ./quotes-connector.yaml
```

To check if the connector is running:

```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy list
```

The connector provisioned the `quotes` topic and it periodically sends a new quote.

## 4. Check the Result

Read from the fluvio topic:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume quotes
```

## 5. Clean-up

The connector is running in the background. Let's shut it down:

```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy shutdown --name http-quotes
```

We can also delete the topic

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio topic delete quotes
```
