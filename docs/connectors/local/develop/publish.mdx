Connector Hub is a public repository for connectors. You can publish your connector as `private` to use on different computers or `pubic` to share it with the community.

### Publish Connector to Hub

Use `cdk publish` to publish your connector to the Hub. If run without arguments, it will pack everything needed into a package and push the package to the Hub.


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk publish
```

The connector is now available for download from the Hub.


### Show Hub Connectors

Run `cdk hub list` to list connectors in the Hub.


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk hub list
  CONNECTOR                          Visibility
  infinyon-labs/graphite-sink@0.1.2  public
  infinyon/duckdb-sink@0.1.0         public
  infinyon/http-sink@0.2.6           public
  infinyon/http-source@0.3.0         public
  infinyon/kafka-sink@0.2.7          public
  infinyon/kafka-source@0.2.5        public
  infinyon/mqtt-source@0.2.5         public
  infinyon/sql-sink@0.3.3            public
  acme/my-connector0.1.0             private
```

You will see all `public` connectors and your own `private` connectors.
