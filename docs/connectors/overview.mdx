# Connectors Overview 

Fluvio Connectors make the process of importing or exporting data simple.
You can import data with an `Inbound` connector and export data with an `Outbound` connector.

Inbound and outbound connectors fundamentally work in the same way. The only difference is the direction your data is streaming with respect to a Fluvio topic.

- **Protocol**: Parses data according to the wire format corresponding to the endpoint protocol.
- **SmartModules** (optional): One or more user-defined tranformations that filter of shape the data records before passing them along to the next stage of the pipeline.

Smartmodules are powered by WebAssembly (also called wasm). Check out the [SmartModules] page to learn how to apply a tranformation or create a new one.
