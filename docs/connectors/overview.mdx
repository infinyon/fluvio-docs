Fluvio Connectors make the process of importing or exporting data simple.
You can import data with an `Inbound` connector and export data with an `Outbound` connector.

Inbound and outbound connectors fundamentally work in the same way. The only difference is the direction your data is streaming with respect to a Fluvio topic.

- **Protocol**: Parses data according to the wire format of the connected data platform.
- **Extract**: Extracts raw data from the protocol format and packages it neatly into data structures
  that may be used by subsequent stages or be produced directly to a topic.
- **Filter** (optional): A user-provided SmartModule that may determine whether a given record
  should be discarded before sending it over the network to Fluvio, saving bandwidth.
- **Shape** (optional): A user-provided SmartModule that may take the extracted data structures and
  transform them in to an application-specific format.


### Protocol Tranformations

The **Protocol** and **Extract** stages are built directly into the connector. They offer basic access to your data through the various protocols your data sources use. In the **Extract** stage, your data is structured from whatever protocol it is sourced from.


### User-Defined Tranformations

The onnectors allow you to apply your custom tranformations for post-processing (inbound) or pre-processing (outbound)the data from or to an exernal entity. You can chain muliple **Filter** and **Shape** operations as needed.

The user define transformation is powered by WebAssembly (also called wasm) via [SmartModules]. Use the instructions in the [SmartModules] page to learn how to apply a tranformation or create a new one.
