> This section assumes `my-connector` project has been [generated].

After you [start your connectors], you can view their logs for troubleshooting:

### Log

To display the logs, you'll need the connector name:


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy log --name my-my-connector-test-connector
Starting my-connector source connector with CustomConfig { foo: "bar" }
```

### Change the Log Level

By default connectors will use the `info` logging level, you can change the log level by using the `deploy` command argument `--log-level`.

```bash
cdk deploy start --config sample-config.yaml --log-level debug
```

The log levels are:
- `error`
- `warn`
- `info`
- `debug`
- `trace`

Check the log again:

```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy log --name my-my-connector-test-connector
...
DEBUG run:send_and_receive{self=MultiplexerSocket 9}: fluvio_socket::multiplexing: sending request api=0 correlation_id=285
```

Shutdown the connector:

```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy shutdown --name my-my-connector-test-connector
Shutting down connector: my-my-connector-test-connector
 ```

In the next section, we'll take a look at how to use secrets.
