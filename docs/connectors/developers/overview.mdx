# Overview - Build Your Own Connector

[Fluvio Connector Development Kit (CDK)] is a command-line tool whose primary goal is to help developers build, test, deploy Connectors, and publish them to the Hub. CDK only supports connectors developed in the Rust programming language. Other languages will be added in future releases.

### Requirements

Install Rust compiler and Cargo.

```bash copy="fl"
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

For additional information visit [Install Rust] guide.

Next add the musl toolchain:

```bash copy="fl"
$ rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Some Linux distributions will also require adding a musl compiler package.


### Steps

The CDK command line allows developers to build, test, and publish Connectors to the Hub:

1. [Generate a Connector]
2. [Build and Test]
3. [Start and Shutdown]
4. [Logging]
5. [Secrets]
6. [Publish to Connector Hub]
