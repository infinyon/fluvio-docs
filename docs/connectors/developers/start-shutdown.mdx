### Connector start

[Testing] your connector runs the process in the foreground. Use `cdk deploy start` to run your connector in the background:


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy start --config sample-config.yaml
Log file: /private/tmp/my-connector/my-connector.log
Connector runs with process id: 88589
```

### List running connectors

CDK offers a convenience function to list running connectors:


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy list
 NAME                            STATUS
 my-my-connector-test-connector  Running
```

You can use the connector name to shut it down.

### Connector shutdown

Stop a running your connector with `cdk deploy shutdown`


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy shutdown --name my-my-connector-test-connector
Shutting down connector: my-my-connector-test-connector
pid: 56421
 ```

In the next section, we'll take a look at the logs for troubleshooting.
