Connector Hub is a public repository for connectors. You can publish your connector as `private` to use on different computers or `pubic` to share it with the community.

### Publish Connector to Hub

Use `cdk publish` to publish your connector to the Hub. If run without arguments, it will pack everything needed into a package and push the package to the Hub.


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk publish
```

The connector is now available for download from the Hub.


### Show Hub Connectors

Run `cdk hub list` to list connectors in the Hub.


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk hub list
  CONNECTOR                          Visibility
  infinyon-labs/graphite-sink@0.1.2  public
  infinyon/duckdb-sink@0.1.0         public
  infinyon/http-sink@0.2.6           public
  infinyon/http-source@0.3.0         public
  infinyon/kafka-sink@0.2.7          public
  infinyon/kafka-source@0.2.5        public
  infinyon/mqtt-source@0.2.5         public
  infinyon/sql-sink@0.3.3            public
  acme/my-connector0.1.0             private
```

You will see all `public` connectors and your own `private` connectors.


### Download from Hub & Run

You can download and run any connector from the Hub. In this example, we'll create new directory to download and run `acme/my-connector0.1.0` connector:



```bash copy="fl"
$ mkdir test-conn; cd test-conn
```

Download the connector:


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk hub download acme/my-connector0.1.0
```

Use connector `.ipkg` package file and run it with the `--ipkg` option:


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy start --ipkg acme/my-connector0.1.0.ipkg --config ../sample-config.yaml
```

This command assumes that the sample config is in the parent directory.


#### Run an Official Connector

You can use the same step-by-step to download and run an official connecgtor. Check the connector documetation to ensure the configuration file is correct.
