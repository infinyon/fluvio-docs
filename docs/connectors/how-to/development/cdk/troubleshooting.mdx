> This section assumes `my-connector` project has been [generated](/docs/connectors/how-to/development/cdk/generate).

After you [start your connectors], you can view their logs for troubleshooting:

### Log

To display the logs, you'll need the connector name:


```bash copy="fl"
$ cdk deploy log --name my-my-connector-test-connector
Starting my-connector source connector with CustomConfig { foo: "bar" }
```

#### Changing the Log Level

By default connectors will use the `info` logging level, you can change the log level by using the `deploy` command argument `--log-level`.

```bash
cdk deploy start --config sample-config.yaml --log-level debug
```

The log levels are:
- `error`
- `warn`
- `info`
- `debug`
- `trace`

In the [next section](/docs/connectors/how-to/development/cdk/secrets) we'll take a look at how to use secrets.
