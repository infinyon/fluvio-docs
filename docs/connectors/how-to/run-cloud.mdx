# Run Connectors on Cloud

Check [the Hub] for a library of connectors that you can download and run. This document will guide you through downloading and running a certified connector in [InfinyOn Cloud].

## Prerequisites

This document assumes that you have provisioned a Cluster in your InfinyOn Cloud account. If you have not done so, please use the [following instructions][InfinyOn Cloud].


## 1. Create a Connector Configuration File

Let's create new directory for the connector configuration file:

```bash copy="fl"
$ mkdir http-source-cloud; cd http-source-cloud
```

Create `quotes-config.yml` and paste the following configuration:

```yaml
# quotes-config.yaml
apiVersion: 0.1.0
meta:
  version: 0.3.8
  name: http-quotes
  type: http-source
  topic: quotes
http:
  endpoint: https://demo-data.infinyon.com/api/quote
  interval: 2s
```

The configuration file ask the `http-source` connector to read a new quote `quote` from the `demo-data` server every 2 seconds.

## 2. Run the `http-source` Connector

Use the configuration file and create a new connector:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector create -c quotes-config.yaml
```

Switch the log level `--log-level debug`. The log level can be set to `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.

To check if the connector is running:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector list
```

The connector provisioned the `quotes` topic and it periodically sends a new quote.


## 3. Check the Result

Read from the fluvio topic:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio consume quotes
```

Show the logs:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector log http-quotes
```


## 4. Clean-up

The connector will continue to run and consume your credits. Let's shut it down:

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio cloud connector delete http-quotes
```

We can also delete the topic

```bash copy="fl"
$ fluvio topic delete quotes
```
