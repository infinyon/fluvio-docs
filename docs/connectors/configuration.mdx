# Connector Configuration File

This is a template YAML connector file that needs to be populated to be functional. In the next section, we will explore the different sections of the connector configuration file and how to properly configure each one.

```yaml title="connector.yaml"
apiVersion: 0.1.0

meta:
 name:
 version:
 type:
 topic:

 # optional (inbound connectors)
 producer:
   # optional
   linger:
   # optional
   batch-size:
   # optional
   compression:

 # optional (outbound connectors)
 consumer:
   # optional as default, but required if offset strategy is provided
   id:
   # optional
   offset:
    strategy:
    start:
    flush:
   # optional
   partition:
   # optional
   max_bytes:

 # optional
 secrets:
   - name: secret_1

# optional
transforms:
 - uses: smartmodule_name
   with:
     param_name: param_value
```

## Connector `apiVersion` configuration

The `apiVersion` is the version of the connector API that the connector uses to parse the configuration file. The current accepted version is `0.1.0`.

## Connector `meta` configuration

The `meta` section contains the metadata for the connector:

* The `name` is the name of the connector. e.g. `my-connector`.
* The `type` is the type of the connector. e.g. `http-source`, `http-sink`, `mqtt-source`.
  * See the [connectors] section for the full list of connectors supported.
* The `version` is the version of the connector. e.g. `0.1.0`.
* The `topic` is the topic that the connector will connect to. e.g. `my-topic`. The topic will be created automatically if it does not exist.
* The `secrets`(optional) is a list of secrets that the connector will use. This accepts a list of objects with the key `name`.
  * See the [secrets] section for more information.
* The `producer`(optional) is the producer configuration for the connector. Currently, this is only used for `source`/`inbound` connectors. The current supported configurations are `linger`, `compression` and `batch_size`. All configurations are optional. See examples to a list of valid values for each configuration.
* The `consumer`(optional) is the consumer configuration for the connector. Currently, this is only used for `sink`/`outbound` connectors. The current supported configurations are `id`, `partition`, `max_bytes` and `offset`. All configurations are optional. See examples to a list of valid values for each configuration.

At minimum connector configuration would look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: 0.1.0
meta:
 name: my-connector
 type: my-connector-type
 version: x.y.z
 topic: my-topic
```

All other fields are optional.

:::info
The `x.y.z` version should be updated with the version of the latest connector in [the Hub].
:::

## Connector `transforms` configuration

Connectors support `transforms`. Records can be modified before they are sent to the topic. The `transforms` section is a list of `transform` objects. Each `transform` object has an `uses` and a `with` section.

* `uses` is the reference to the SmartModule used in the transform.
* `with` is the configuration for the transform

## Consumer with Offset

Consumers can be configured with different `start` offsets to determine where to begin consuming records from a topic.

The following options are available for the `start` offset:

- **`absolute: x`**: Starts consuming from the absolute index `x` of the topic.
- **`beginning`**: Starts consuming from the very beginning of the topic.
- **`from-beginning: x`**: Starts consuming from index `x` from the beginning of the topic.
- **`end`**: Starts consuming from the end of the topic.
- **`from-end: x`**: Starts consuming from index `x` from the end of the topic.

### Offset Management

Offset management is a Fluvio feature that stores the offset of the last consumed record. This is especially useful when a connector is stopped and restarted, as it allows the connector to resume consumption from the last saved offset rather than starting over.

The behavior of offset management depends on the `strategy` field. When `strategy` is set to `auto` or `manual`, offset management is enabled, and the `start` rule is based on the saved offset rather than the entire topic.

The `strategy` field supports the following values:

- **`auto`**: Automatically commits the offset after each record is consumed.
- **`manual`**: Requires the user to commit the offset manually.
- **`none`**: Disables offset management entirely.

### Example Configuration

A consumer connector with offset management might look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: 0.1.0
meta:
  name: my-connector
  type: my-connector-type
  version: x.y.z
  topic: my-topic
consumer:
  id: my-consumer
  offset:
    strategy: auto
    start: beginning 
    flush: 10s
```
