# Connector Build Troubleshooting

## Multiplatform builds

Connectors on the Hub can be published associated with multiple targets so
they can be run multiple platforms. This can be accomplished by building cdk on
the same target it's intended for, or cross compiling one target from another
platform.  Compiling for one target while on another target can be complex, so
this troubleshooting section provides added target toolchain support information
for some common platfom/target combinations.

## MacOS

Build command for local builds, if `cdk build` does not work, explicitly specify
the target:

```bash
cdk build --target aarch64-apple-darwin
```

## Ubuntu or Debian based Linux Distributions {#ubuntu-debian}

Build prerequisites for `x86-unknown-linux-musl` on Ubuntu from an
`x86-unknown-linux-gnu` environment.

System packages:
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential musl-tools
```

Build command to build and test locally, instead of 'cdk build', use the
following:

```bash
CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_MUSL_LINKER=x86_64-linux-musl-gcc cdk build
```

## Other rust cargo cross-platform build toolchains

Connector projects are rust projects, and different choices exist for cross
compilation.  A project connector binary build by a rust toolchain can be
published by `cdk` with a `--no-build` flag.  Different cross compilation
projects for rust include:

- Cargo cross https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
- Cargo zigbuild https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-zigbuild

For a working example, see the [connector-publish github workflow].

## Windows, WSL, WSL2

Fluvio and `cdk` are supported for windows only though WSL2.  WSL2 often installs
Ubuntu as the default Linux distrubition. See the [Ubuntu] section for more
build troubleshooting.

## Infinyon Cloud Certified Connectors

Infinyon Certified connectors are built for the `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` target.

To build and publish for the cloud, InfinyOn often uses a [connector-publish github workflow].
