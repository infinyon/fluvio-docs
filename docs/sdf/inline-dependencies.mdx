For inline operators, you can add `dependencies` section to include external language specific libraries. The dependencies are defined in the `dependencies` section of the operator definition. The dependencies are resolved by the Fluvio engine and made available to the operator at runtime.


## External Dependencies

For Rust based operators, the dependencies are based on Rust Cargo package manager similar to `dependencies` section in [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html).

For example, following variations are possible:

Adding a crate with version:

```yaml
 - operator: map
   dependencies:
     - name: regex
       version: "1.10.0"
```

Adding a git repository:

```yaml
 - operator: map
   dependencies:
     - name: regex
       git: "https://github.com/rust-lang/regex"
       tag: "1.10.0"
```

Adding multiple dependencies:

```yaml
 - operator: map
   dependencies:
     - name: regex
       version: "1.10.0"
     - name: iter_tools
       version: "0.15.0"
```

Once the dependencies are added, inline operator can use the dependencies in the `run` section as in the typical Rust code as example below which tries to validate the year format.

```yaml
- operator: filter
  dependencies:
    - name: regex
      version: "1.10.0"
  run: |
    fn validate_year(input: String) -> Result<bool, String> {
        use std::sync::OnceLock;
        use regex::Regex;

        static REGEX: OnceLock<Regex> = OnceLock::new();

        let re = REGEX.get_or_init(|| Regex::new(r"^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$").unwrap());
        Ok(re.is_match(&input))
    }
```


## InfinyOn Dependencies

The Stateful Dataflow requires external dependencies to invoke an HTTP call-out and other operations.


### HTTP Callout

The http callout function makes it easy to make HTTP requests from your service operator. The call-out library is based on the `reqwest` library.  To use the http callout, add a git dependency in your operator definition.

```yaml
- operator: map
  dependencies:
      - name: sdf-http
        git: "https://github.com/infinyon/sdf-guest-http"
        tag: "v0.3.0"
```

Following snippet takes a sentence and translate english to spanish using external API.   The [Request](https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.11.24/reqwest/struct.Request.html) is part of `reqwest` library and `sdf_http::blocking::send` is used to send the request.


```yaml
- operator: map
  dependencies:
      - name: sdf-http
        git: "https://github.com/infinyon/sdf-guest-http"
        tag: "v0.3.0"
  run: |
    fn english_to_spanish(sentence: String) -> Result<String, String> {
        use  sdf_http::http::Request;

        let url = format!("https://acme.com/translate?text={}", sentence);
        let request = Request::builder().uri(url).body("").map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
        let response = sdf_http::blocking::send(request).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
        Ok(response.into_body())
    }
```
