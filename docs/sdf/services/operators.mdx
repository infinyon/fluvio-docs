**Operators** are APIs that enable developers to customize their data applications. The operators have opinionated function signatures and flexible types. Some operators can be used independently, whereas others must be chained to accomplish the task.

#### Summary

The engine implements the following `operators`:

* [map](#map)
* [filter](#filter)
* [filter-map](#filter-map)
* [flat-map](#flat-map)
* [assign-timestamp](#assign-timestamp)
* [assign-key](#assign-key)
* [update-state](#update-state)
* [flush](#flush)

The engine also uses `reserved keywords` to identify a multi-step operation, such as:

* [partition](#partition)
* [window](#window)

Let's take a look at each operator in detail.


### `map`

The `map` operator takes an input record, applies a transformation, and forwards the modified record to the next operator.

For example, given a user record, you can mask their social security number with the following `map` operation:

```yaml
- operator: map
  run: |
    fn mask_ssn(user: User) -> Result<User, String> {
      let mut u = user.clone();
      u.ssn = u.ssn.replace(|c: char| c.is_digit(10), "*");
      Ok(u)
    }
```

### `filter`

The `filter` operator takes a record and returns a boolean that tells the engine whether to drop it or forward it to the next operator:

  * `true` - foward the record to the next operator.
  * `false` - drop the record.

While in most cases, one operator's output becomes the next operator's input; the `filter` operation works differently. The operator returns a boolean to control the state, and the engine then sends the record to the next operator.

The following example defines a `filter` that drops all sentences without a question mark:


```yaml
- operator: filter
  run: |
    fn filter_questions(input: String) -> Result<bool, String> {
      Ok(input.contains("?"))
    }
```

### `filter-map`

The `filter-map` operator combines a filter and a map operation; it takes a record and returns a modified record or none. The return value tells the engine to forward the records to the next operator or to drop them:

  * `Some(Record)` - foward the record to the next operator.
  * `None` - drop the record.

The following example defines a `filter-map` that transforms sentences longer than ten characters to uppercase and drops all others:


```yaml
- operator: filter-map
  run: |
    fn long_sentence_to_uppercase(input: String) -> Result<Option<String>, String> {
      if input.len() > 10 {
        Ok(Some(input.to_uppercase()))
      } else {
        Ok(None)
      }
    }
```

### `flat-map`

The `flat-map` operator takes an aggregate record and returns an array of records. The engine reads the array and sends individual records, one at a time, to the next operator.

The following example defines a `flat-map` that splits sentences into words:


```yaml
- operator: flat-map
  run: |
    fn split_sentence(sentence: String) -> Result<Vec<String>, String> {
      Ok(sentence.split_whitespace().map(String::from).collect())
    }
```

### `assign-timestamp`

The `assign-timestamp` operator lets you choose a timestamp for window processing. Timestamps help the engine distributed records to windows. The timestamp may be defined from the record metadata or from the record value.

##### Assign timestamp from record metadata

The following example shows how to update the timestamp from the record metadata, passed down through the `event_time` field:

```yaml
- operator: assign-timestamp
  run: |
    fn assign_timestamp(sentence: String, event_time: i64) -> Result<i64, String> {
      Ok(event_time)
    }
```

Check out <a href="https://github.com/infinyon/stateful-dataflows-examples/blob/main/dataflows-inline/word-counter/" target="_blank">word-counter example in github</a> for a working demo.


##### Assign timestamp from record value

Assuming a user_event record has a `timestamp` field, the following example shows how to update the timestamp from the record value:


```yaml
- operator: assign-timestamp
  run: |
    fn assign_timestamp(user_event: UserEvent, _event_time: i64) -> Result<i64, String> {
      Ok(user_event.timestamp)
    }
```

The `assign_timestamp` operation is mandatory in window processing


### `assign-key`

The `assign-key` operation assigns a key to the record metadata. The engine uses the key to determine which records to group in the same partition.

The following example shows how the assign-key operator groups cars by their color:

```yaml
- operator: assign-key
  run: |
    fn key_by_color(car: Car) -> Result<String, String> {
      Ok(car.color)
    }
```

Check out <a href="https://github.com/infinyon/stateful-dataflows-examples/blob/main/dataflows-inline/car-processing/" target="_blank">car-count example in github</a> for a working demo.



### `update-state`

The `update-state` operator informs engine that a state object update is imminent, and this is the last step for the service.

The following example shows how the `update-state` operator updates the state object `temperature()` with the latest temperature value:

```yaml
- operator: update-state
  run: |
    fn update_temperature(event: Temp) -> Result<(), String> {
      let mut temp = temperature();
      temp.sensor = event.sensor;
      temp.temperature = event.temperature;
      temp.update();
      Ok(())
    }
```

### `flush`

The `flush` operator is the final stage of a window processing service. The engine invokes flush after the watermark closes the window. The flush API is expected to return a value passed to the sink.

Assuming a window operator that generates a state object that counts car colors, the following example shows how the `flush` operator returns a list of colors and their counts:

```yaml
flush:
  run: |
    fn get_car_color_count() -> Result<CarColors, String> {
      let mut cc = count_by_color().clone();
      Ok(cc.iter().map(|entry|
        Color {
          color: entry.key.clone(),
          count: entry.value
        }
      ).collect())
    }
```

### `partition`

The `partition` operation divides the stream into data sets that are processed in parallel. The partition operation has the following sub-sections:

* `assign-key` - to assign a key to the record metadata
* `transforms` - to perform a chain of transformations
* `update-state` - to update the state object

While `update-state` is not mandatory, it is the most common use case for partition.

The following example shows how the `partition` operation divides the stream into words and updates the state object `count_per_word()` with the latest word count:

```yaml
partition:
  assign-key:
    run: |
      fn assign_word_key(word: String) -> Result<String, String> {
        Ok(word.to_lowercase().chars().filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric()).collect())
      }

  transforms:
    - operator: update-state
      run: |
        fn increment_word_count(word: String) -> Result<(), String> {
          count_per_word().increment(1);
          Ok(())
        }
```

### `window`

The `window` operation turns streams of records into finite groups of records captured based on the window size. The window operation is a multi-state operation with the following sub-section:

* [assign-timestamp](#assign-timestamp)
* [partition](#partition)
* [assign-key](#assign-key)
* [update-state](#update-state)
* [flush](#flush)

While there are several types of windows, and the engine will eventually implement all of them, the first version supports tumbling window. A `tumbling window` is a window that is continuous and non-overlapping.

Building on the example above, a tumbling window of 20 seconds that computes the top 3 words in a stream of sentences has the following hierarchy:

```yaml
window:
  tumbling:
    duration: 20s

  assign-timestamp:
    run: |
      fn assign_event_timestamp(value: String, event_time: i64) -> Result<i64, String> {
        Ok(event_time)
      }

  partition:
    assign-key:
      run: |
        fn assign_word_key(word: String) -> Result<String, String> {
          Ok(word.to_lowercase().chars().filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric()).collect())
        }

    transforms:
      - operator: update-state
        run: |
          fn increment_word_count(word: String) -> Result<(), String> {
            count_per_word().increment(1);
            Ok(())
          }

  flush:
    run: |
      fn compute_most_used_words() -> Result<TopWords, String> {
        let mut top3 = count_per_word().clone();
        top3.sort_by(|a, b| a.value.cmp(&b.value));
        top3.reverse();
        top3.truncate(3);
        Ok(top3.iter().map(|entry|
          WordCount {
            word: entry.key.clone(),
            count: entry.value
          }
        ).collect())
      }
```

First section is the window properties, followed by partitioning, and finally the flush.
