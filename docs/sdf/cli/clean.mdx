# The `sdf clean` command

Command line syntax for `sdf clean`:

```bash
$  sdf clean -h
Clean generated files from project directory

Usage: sdf clean
```

This command is used to clean-up the project directory and start again.

##### Example

Let's say we made major changes to the `data-pipeline.yaml` file and the previous version is no longer relevant. We can use `clean` to remove the project and start over:


```bash copy="fl"
$ sdf clean
```
