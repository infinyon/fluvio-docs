## Recent events
Our CTO, Sehyo Chang spoke at [Cloud Native Wasm Day EU 2022](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cloud-native-wasm-day-europe/).

The talk was called [Building WASM Powered Distributed Stream Platform](https://cloudnativewasmdayeu22.sched.com/event/zgbb/building-wasm-powered-distributed-stream-platform-sehyo-chang-infinyon).

Thanks to everyone who attended the talk in person and we appreciate [the positive response](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6932389342543851520)! We'll be sure to share a link to the recording when it is available.
