Fluvio is a distributed, programmable streaming platform written in Rust.

This Week in Fluvio is our weekly newsletter for development updates to [Fluvio open source].

---

## New release
* We have a new [Swift Fluvio client preview](https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio-client-swift)
  * Only supports `produce` for iOS projects
  * Uses [swift-bridge](https://github.com/chinedufn/swift-bridge) to interop between Rust and Swift
  * Looking for contributors!

## Thanks
We held a webinar we held on April 12 for Real-time Event Streaming and Data Transformation for Financial Services.

Thanks again for those who showed up and an extra thanks to those who participated in the Q&A!

## Recent events
Fluvio just reached [1000 stars on Github](https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio/stargazers)!
